However, whether there is synchronisation of these strategies at the entire community level is unclear. Here, we combine trait data for >2800 above- and belowground taxa from 14 trophic guilds spanning a disturbance and resource availability gradient in German grasslands. The results indicate that most guilds consistently respond to these drivers through both direct and trophically mediated effects, resulting in a `slow-fast' axis at the level of the entire community. Using 15 indicators of carbon and nutrient fluxes, biomass production and decomposition, we also show that fast trait communities are associated with faster rates of ecosystem functioning. These findings demonstrate that `slow' and `fast' strategies can be manifested at the level of whole communities, opening new avenues of ecosystem-level functional classification.",

For ground nesting species like the primitively eusocial halictid bee, Lasioglossum malachurum, soil temperature might influence the life cycle as well as the complexity of the social group since the number of broods that can be fitted into the flight season might increase with increasing temperature. Our study populationof L. malachurum at Wuerzburg exhibits a remarkable variability with respect to the number of broods and the pattern of sexual production. Broods are separated by activity pauses during which the larvae develop. In this study we investigate the influence of soil temperature on the pattern of nesting activity (duration of broods and pauses) and on the number of broods in L. malachurum. We observed a total of 1138 nests in 13 aggregations near Wuerzburg. As expected, soil temperature shortened the duration of the pauses, resulting in an overall shortening of the nesting cycle. This is most probably due to a physiological effect of soil temperature on the development of the larvae. With regard to the nesting strategies, we hypothesized that a shortening of the nesting cycle within the limited flight season should enhance the success of a strategy with more worker broods. In fact, patches with higher soil temperature showed more broods. However, this effect was rather weak, suggesting that other factors might have a stronger impact on the variability in nesting strategy within our study population of L. malachurum.",

In annual eusocial sweat bees, nest cycles typically consist of a sequence of distinct phases of activity (queen or workers collect food, construct, and provision brood cells) and inactivity (nest is closed). Since the flight season is limited to the time of the year with sufficiently high temperatures and resource availability, every break reduces the potential for foraging and, thus, the productivity of a colony. This apparent waste of time has not gained much attention.",

We propose an alternative model that assumes colony development in discrete broods and a limited overall investment potential of the queen. Based on the costs for producing eggs, workers, and sexuals and efficiency of individuals we predict the optimal number of workers and sexuals in the colony for each brood of the colony cycle that maximizes overall colony fitness. To link our model assumptions to the real world we chose model parameters according to field data of the halictid bee Lasioglossum malachurum. However, our model is representative of a large number of species with an annual life cycle and with discrete broods. Our model shows that the optimal partitioning of resources, i.e. the optimal workers/sexuals ratio depends on rearing cost for sexuals as well as productivity of workers but not on the queens' total investment, egg cost, or rearing cost for workers. In complete accordance to Macevicz and Oster we predict a bang-bang reproduction strategy despite the differences in the basic assumptions. Potential deviations from this strategy and transitions from social to solitary breeding are discussed in the framework of our model.",

However, in several species graded investment strategies with a simultaneous production of workers and sexuals have been observed. Such deviations from the ``bang-bang'' strategy are usually interpreted as an adaptive (bet-hedging) response to environmental fluctuations such as variation in season length or food availability.",

    "volume": "56","number": "2","pages": "119--129","abstract": "Understanding decisions about the allocation of resources into colony growth and reproduction in social insects is one of the challenging issues in sociobiology. In their seminal paper, Macevicz and Oster predicted that, for most annual insect colonies, a bang--bang strategy should be favoured by selection, i.e. a strategy characterised by an ``ergonomic phase'' with exponential colony growth followed by a ``reproductive phase'' with all resources invested into the production of sexuals. Yet, there is empirical evidence for the simultaneous investment into the production of workers and sexuals in annual colonies (graded control). We, therefore, re-analyse and extend the original model of Macevicz and Oster. Using basic calculus, we can show that sufficiently strong negative correlation between colony size and worker efficiency or increasing mortality of workers with increasing colony size will favour the evolution of graded allocation strategies. By similar reasoning, graded control is predicted for other factors limiting colony productivity (for example, if queens' egg laying capacity is limited).",

Energy reserves in insects mostly consist of fat. We investigated how hibernation and the subsequent flight season, especially the solitary nest founding phase, influenced the abdominal fat content of gynes in the primitively eusocial sweat bee, Lasioglossum malachurum (Hymenoptera, Halictidae). In our study population, sexuals are produced in both the second and the third broods. Emerging gynes of the third brood had significantly more fat than those of the second brood, whereas there was no such difference in males. As expected, fat reserves in samples of female sexuals caught at emergence, after hibernation, during solitary nest founding, and at the end of the social phase of the nest cycle indicate a severe decrease of reserves that was highest during the 7 weeks of the solitary founding phase. Thus, the amount of fat reserves of foundress queens seems to be crucial, particularly for nest founding. However, investment of energy reserves in the solitary nest founding phase has probably to be balanced with the subsequent social phase in a way that maximizes the queen's fitness. Possible consequences for the complexity and progress of the nest cycle are discussed.",

    "volume": "10","number": "3","pages": "1-12","abstract": "Existing models explaining the evolution of sexual dimorphism in the timing of emergence (SDT) in Lepidoptera assume equal mortality rates for males and females. The limiting assumption of equal mortality rates has the consequence that these models are only able to explain the evolution of emergence of males before females, i.e. protandry\u2014the more common temporal sequence of emergence in Lepidoptera. The models fail, however, in providing adaptive explanations for the evolution of protogyny, where females emerge before males, but protogyny is not rare in insects. The assumption of equal mortality rates seems too restrictive for many insects, such as butterflies. To investigate the influence of unequal mortality rates on the evolution of SDT, we present a generalised version of a previously published model where we relax this assumption. We find that longer life-expectancy of females compared to males can indeed favour the evolution of protogyny as a fitness enhancing strategy. Moreover, the encounter rate between females and males and the sex-ratio are two important factors that also influence the evolution of optimal SDT. If considered independently for females and males the predicted strategies can be shown to be evolutionarily stable (ESS). Under the assumption of equal mortality rates the difference between the females\u2019 and males\u2019 ESS remains typically very small. However, female and male ESS may be quite dissimilar if mortality rates are different. This creates the potential for an \u2018evolutionary conflict\u2019 between females and males. Bagworm moths (Lepidoptera: Psychidae) provide an exemplary case where life-history attributes are such that protogyny should indeed be the optimal emergence strategy from the males\u2019 and females\u2019 perspectives: (i) Female longevity is considerably larger than that of males, (ii) encounter rates between females and males are presumably low, and (iii) females mate only once. Protogyny is indeed the general mating strategy found in the bagworm family.",

In contrast, ``sequential mass provisioners'' supply offspring one after another (SEQ). Utilizing individual-based simulations, Field (Nature 404:869--871, 2005) compared the lifetime reproductive success of these strategies in different scenarios. Accordingly, SEQ should evolve in the majority of cases---SIM only has an evolutionary benefit if offspring depend on their mothers' protection until adulthood even past the provisioning period. However, this is only one potential explanation for the evolution of SIM. Here, we present an alternative mechanism for solitary individuals with overlapping generations. We propose an analytical model (comprising Field's former approach) utilizing growth rate instead of lifetime reproductive success as a measure of fitness. Our model shows that multiplicative geometric effects on fitness would typically compensate for the demographic disadvantages of SIM (due to prolonged dependency) and consequently support the evolution of SIM over SEQ for a wide range of life history parameters. The optimal level of SIM (i.e., the optimal number of eggs laid simultaneously) is determined by offspring development time, survival rates, and foraging efficiency of the mother. Only extreme values of these demographic parameters would favor a transition to SEQ behavior. Our model provides a coherent explanation of selective favoring of SIM over SEQ that may also contribute to understanding why SIM is the dominant strategy among social insect species.",

Researchers have invested some effort to find possible correlates (proximate triggers) of this transition but current empirical knowledge does not provide clear evidence. Utilizing an established theoretical model---modified to account for brood developmental time---we show that a strategy that switches to the production of sexuals at a particular (fixed) date may typically perform better than strategies linking the transition to the status of the colony in terms of attributes like worker or brood number, or the colony's age. Our results provide rationale why the search for cues triggering the transition in investment has been inconclusive at best and suggests a number of experiments and observations that allow validating our arguments.",

    "volume": "14","number": "1","pages": "6191","abstract": "Tropical forest recovery is fundamental to addressing the intertwined climate and biodiversity loss crises. While regenerating trees sequester carbon relatively quickly, the pace of biodiversity recovery remains contentious. Here, we use bioacoustics and metabarcoding to measure forest recovery post-agriculture in a global biodiversity hotspot in Ecuador. We show that the community composition, and not species richness, of vocalizing vertebrates identified by experts reflects the restoration gradient. Two automated measures -- an acoustic index model and a bird community composition derived from an independently developed Convolutional Neural Network - correlated well with restoration (adj-R² = 0.62 and 0.69, respectively). Importantly, both measures reflected composition of non-vocalizing nocturnal insects identified via metabarcoding. We show that such automated monitoring tools, based on new technologies, can effectively monitor the success of forest recovery, using robust and reproducible data.",

    "volume": "27","number": "1","pages": "90--105","abstract": "Forest decline caused by climate change has been a growing challenge for European foresters for decades. The accumulation of tree-related microhabitats (TreMs) and deadwood during decline can enhance stand structural heterogeneity and provide crucial habitat features for many forest ecological guilds. We analysed changes in deadwood and TreM assemblages using a trait-based approach in three case studies: drought-induced decline in highland Pyrenean fir and lowland oak forests, and windstorm/pest-induced dieback in highland Bavarian spruce forests. Decline caused significant changes in deadwood and TreM characteristics and composition in three forest contexts. However, tree density with cavities, exudates, or crown deadwood was not linked to decline intensity. Declining conifer forests had more large deadwood and downed woody debris, and their TreM assemblages were more saproxylic, less epixylic, and included more cracks and exposed sapwood. TreM assemblages in drought-declining forests had higher diversity, functional richness, and more dead tops than healthy stands. In Bavarian spruce forests, there was more decayed downed deadwood, and the TreM assemblages were more associated with the base of the tree, snags, and logs. Overall, forest decline significantly boosts ecological niche resources, typically scarce in managed forests, which could benefit many forest biodiversity groups. Though post-disturbance management should respect tree species-dependent economic balance and avoid phytosanitary risks, it should also consider the ecological benefits of decline-induced heterogeneity.",

    "pages": "e06807","abstract": "Climate and land use are major determinants of biodiversity, and declines in species richness in cold and human exploited landscapes can be caused by lower rates of biotic interactions. Deadwood fungi and bacteria interact strongly with their hosts due to long-lasting evolutionary trajectories. However, how rates of biotic interactions (specialization) change with temperature and land-use intensity are unknown for both microbial groups. We hypothesize a decrease in species richness and specialization of communities with decreasing temperature and increasing land use intensity while controlling for precipitation. We used a full-factorial nested design to disentangle land use at habitat and landscape scale and temperature spanning an area of 300 × 300 km in Germany. We exposed four deadwood objects representing the main tree species in Central Europe (beech, oak, spruce, pine) in 175 study plots. Overall, we found that fungal and bacterial richness, community composition and specialization were weakly related to temperature and land use. Fungal richness was slightly higher in near-natural than in urban landscapes. Bacterial richness was positively associated with mean annual temperature, negatively associated with local temperature and highest in grassland habitats. Bacterial richness was positively related to the covariate mean annual precipitation. We found strong effects of host-tree identity on species richness and community composition. A generally high level of fungal host-tree specialization might explain the weak response to temperature and land use. Effects of host-tree identity and specialization were more pronounced in fungi. We suggest that host tree changes caused by land use and climate change will be more important for fungal communities, while changes in climate will affect bacterial communities more directly. Contrasting responses of the two taxonomic groups suggest a reorganization of deadwood microbial communities, which might have further consequences on diversity and decomposition in the Anthropocene.",

    "volume": "2023","pages": "12","abstract": "Because animal carcasses often serve as reservoirs for pathogens, their location and removal are crucial in controlling the spread of diseases. During carcass decomposition, heat is emitted due to microbial activity and the development of maggots. Recent studies have shown that infrared sensors can be used to locate animal carcasses, but little is known about the factors influencing detection success. In this study, we investigated the potential of infrared technology to locate wild boar carcasses, as they play an important role in the spread of African swine fever. Specifically, we tested the effects of environmental and carcass conditions on the detection probability. A drone-based thermal camera was used to collect data during 379 flyovers of 42 wild boar carcasses in different stages of decomposition between September 2020 and July 2021. Generalized mixed-effect models and conditional inference trees were used to identify the environmental and carcass conditions that influenced the detection probability. Our results showed that the thermal camera accurately measured carcass temperature (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;#x2009;=&amp;#x2009;0.75, RMSE&amp;#x2009;=&amp;#x2009;5.89&amp;#x00B0;C). The probability of finding carcasses was higher in open habitats with air temperatures &amp;gt;3.0&amp;#x00B0;C and thus conducive to maggot development (detection rate &amp;#x2264;80&amp;#x0025;). A forest canopy openness &amp;gt;29.3&amp;#x0025; and cloudy conditions or flights at dawn increased the detection rate. Moreover, carcasses infested with large amounts of maggots could be detected even in habitats with a more extensive canopy cover, whereas in dense forests, the detection probability was limited (&amp;lt;25&amp;#x0025;). Carcasses in an advanced stage of decomposition could still be detected as long as the difference between the carcass temperature and the air temperature was &amp;gt;6.4&amp;#x00B0;C (&amp;#x2264;62&amp;#x0025;).

    "volume": "36","number": "3","pages": "271-285","abstract": "The adaptive significance of adjusting behavioral activities to the\r\n   right time of the day seems obvious. Laboratory studies implicated an\r\n   important role of circadian clocks in behavioral timing and rhythmicity.\r\n   Yet, recent studies on clock-mutant animals questioned this importance\r\n   under more naturalistic settings, as various clock mutants showed nearly\r\n   normal diel activity rhythms under seminatural zeitgeber conditions. We\r\n   here report evidence that proper timing of eclosion, a vital behavior of\r\n   the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, requires a functional molecular\r\n   clock under quasi-natural conditions. In contrast to wild-type flies,\r\n   period(01) mutants with a defective molecular clock showed impaired\r\n   rhythmicity and gating in a temperate environment even in the presence\r\n   of a full complement of abiotic zeitgebers. Although period(01) mutants\r\n   still eclosed during a certain time window during the day, this time\r\n   window was much broader and loosely defined, and rhythmicity was lower\r\n   or lost as classified by various statistical measures. Moreover, peak\r\n   eclosion time became more susceptible to variable day-to-day changes of\r\n   light. In contrast, flies with impaired peptidergic interclock signaling\r\n   (Pdf(01) and han(5304) PDF receptor mutants) eclosed mostly rhythmically\r\n   with normal gate sizes, similar to wild-type controls. Our results\r\n   suggest that the presence of natural zeitgebers is not sufficient, and a\r\n   functional molecular clock is required to induce stable temporal\r\n   eclosion patterns in flies under temperate conditions with considerable\r\n   day-to-day variation in light intensity and temperature. Temperate\r\n   zeitgebers are, however, sufficient to functionally rescue a loss of\r\n   PDF-mediated clock-internal and -output signaling",

    "abstract": "The life cycle of many social insects living in seasonal environments is characterized by a period of (pure) investment into worker brood followed by a phase of pure allocation of resources to the production of sexuals. Researchers have invested some effort to find possible correlates (proximate triggers) of this transition but current empirical knowledge does not provide clear evidence. Utilizing an established theoretical model---modified to account for brood developmental time---we show that a strategy that switches to the production of sexuals at a particular (fixed) date may typically perform better than strategies linking the transition to the status of the colony in terms of attributes like worker or brood number, or the colony's age. Our results provide rationale why the search for cues triggering the transition in investment has been inconclusive at best and suggests a number of experiments and observations that allow validating our arguments.",

Although the declines have been attributed to land use and climate change, supporting evidence suffers from low taxonomic resolution, short time series, a focus on local scales, and the collinearity of the identified drivers. In this study, we conducted a systematic assessment of insect populations in southern Germany, which showed that differences in insect biomass and richness are highly context dependent. We found the largest difference in biomass between semi-natural and urban environments (−42%), whereas differences in total richness (−29%) and the richness of threatened species (−56%) were largest from semi-natural to agricultural environments. These results point to urbanization and agriculture as major drivers of decline. We also found that richness and biomass increase monotonously with increasing temperature, independent of habitat. The contrasting patterns of insect biomass and richness question the use of these indicators as mutual surrogates. Our study provides support for the implementation of more comprehensive measures aimed at habitat restoration in order to halt insect declines.",

    "volume": "487","abstract": "Wood-living beetles make up a large proportion of forest biodiversity and contribute to important ecosystem services, including decomposition. Beetle communities in managed southern boreal forests are less species rich than in natural and near-natural forest stands. In addition, many beetle species rely primarily on specific tree species. Yet, the associations between individual beetle species, forest management category, and tree species are seldom quantified, even for red-listed beetles. We compiled a beetle capture dataset from flight intercept traps placed on Norway spruce (Picea abies), oak (Quercus sp.), and Eurasian aspen (Populus tremulae) trees in 413 sites in mature managed forest, near-natural forest, and clear-cuts in southeastern Norway. We used joint species distribution models to estimate the strength of associations for 368 saproxylic beetle species (including 20 vulnerable, endangered, or critical red-listed species) for each forest management category and tree species. Tree species on which traps were mounted had the largest effect on beetle communities; oaks had the most highly associated beetle species, including most of the red-listed species, followed by Norway spruce and Eurasian aspen. Most beetle species were more likely to be captured in near-natural than in mature managed forest. Our estimated associations were compatible \u2013 for many species \u2013 with categorical classifications found in several existing databases of saproxylic beetle preferences. These quantitative beetle-habitat associations will improve future analyses that have typically relied on categorical classifications. Our results highlight the need to prioritize conservation of near-natural forests and oak trees in Scandinavia to protect the habitat of many red-listed species in particular. Furthermore, we underline the importance of carefully considering the species of trees on which traps are mounted in order to representatively sample beetle communities in forest stands.",

    "volume": "254","number": "10","abstract": "Protected areas worldwide are important to maintaining biodiversity and providing recreational opportunities to society. However, many protected areas are affected by unprecedented, large and severe natural disturbances, like bark beetle outbreaks. Due to the contrasting responses of different taxonomic groups to disturbance events and largely negative human perceptions of disturbed landscapes, there are conflicting opinions about the appropriate way of managing affected stands. Aligning these different objectives and understanding the responses of biodiversity and visitors' perceptions to different disturbance severities is a prerequisite for disturbance management in protected areas. We conducted multi-taxon biodiversity surveys \u2013 including meta-barcoding hyperdiverse groups such as insects and fungi \u2013 and analysed the restorativeness (i.e. the landscape's ability to renew personal cognitive capacities for forest visitors) using visitor surveys in five national parks throughout Europe. Response curves of biodiversity and restorativeness were analysed along a continuous gradient of bark beetle infestation severities in Norway spruce forests on the same study plots. Arthropod biomass and the diversity of primary producers and pollinators increased linearly with increasing disturbance severity, while overall multi-diversity (an index of the average scaled species richness per taxonomic group) did not change. Restorativeness decreased linearly with increasing disturbance severity; however, even heavily disturbed forests still had high restorativeness. In spite of the ongoing debates about disturbance management, the high biodiversity and restorativeness that accompany disturbance suggest that major goals of protected areas are not threatened by bark beetle disturbances.",

    "volume": "482","abstract": "Natural disturbances are major drivers of forest dynamics. However, in the current context of anthropogenic global warming, shifts in disturbance regimes are expected. Natural disturbances usually leave biological or structural legacies which are important for early-successional species. Nevertheless, these legacies are usually eliminated by forest managers through salvage logging. Here, we investigated the consequences of forest dieback and the following salvage logging on both forest habitat conditions and saproxylic beetle communities. We conducted our study in two types of conifer-dominated highland forests: Pyrenean silver fir (Abies alba) which has suffered drought-induced dieback and Bavarian Norway spruce (Picea abies) which has suffered bark beetle-induced (Ips typographus) dieback. In both of the forest contexts, dieback provided a biological legacy through an increase in deadwood resources; however, this increase was much greater in the spruce forests. Nonetheless, despite this increase in resources, neither type of forest gained in total abundance or species richness after disturbance, compared to healthy stands. Nevertheless, the species composition of saproxylic beetle composition was significantly affected by dieback in spruce stands, but not in the silver fir forests. In the spruce plots, saproxylic beetles responded positively to the large increase in deadwood in the declining stands, including a very strong positive response from red-listed species. Saproxylic beetle assemblages in spruce forests were mainly drove by canopy openness and deadwood amount. In the silver fir plots, we did not observed responses from the saproxylic beetle communities to deadwood amount increase. This lack of response may be explained by the relatively low amount of deadwood generated by the drought-induced dieback. Concerning salvage logging, it caused stronger contrasts in spruce forests than in silver fir forests, where it generally had no significant impact. For example, in spruce forests, salvage logging reduced the density of large snags by 91% and large logs by 87% compared with unharvested declining plots. Most of the significant environmental effects on biodiversity associated with dieback were no longer significant after accounting for the salvaged plots in our study data. Then, forest dieback and salvage logging induced much sharper and stronger effects on environmental and community metrics in the spruce than in the silver fir forests. The contrast between Bavaria and the French Pyrenees seems partly related to dieback severity. Finally, we invite forest managers to conserve biological and structural legacies through patches of deadwood-rich areas.",

    "volume": "481","pages": "118721","abstract": "After natural forest disturbances such as wildfires, windstorms and insect outbreaks, salvage logging is commonly applied to reduce economic losses and mitigate subsequent disturbance risk. However, this practice is controversial due to its potential ecological impacts, and its capacity to mitigate or increase the risk of subsequent disturbances remains unclear. Salvage logging removes and alters the legacies remaining after natural disturbances, and it produces additional management legacies. Consequently, salvage logging has the potential to alter the functional connection between natural disturbances and also produce new functional connections to additional disturbances. We reviewed the efficacy of salvage logging in mitigating the risk of subsequent wildfire, insect outbreaks, hydrologic disturbances, mass movements, windthrow, browsing, and microclimatic stress. We asked: (1) Does salvage logging modify resistance to subsequent disturbances? (2) Through what mechanisms do such effects operate? Based on 96 publications, salvage logging can reduce total ecosystem fuels but increase small ground fuels and produce drier fuels in the short term, reduce bark beetle host trees and beetle-tree connectivity (though with little evidence for outbreak mitigation), magnify erosion and flood impacts of disturbance but with uncertain watershed-scale implications, increase susceptibility to windthrow at artificially created stand edges, remove the protective function of deadwood in preventing rockfall and avalanches, alter browsing pressure by modifying forage availability and hiding cover for herbivores and predators, and increase microclimatic stress due to greater radiation and temperature fluctuations. We propose a decision-making framework to evaluate the suitability of salvage logging to manage subsequent disturbances. It contemplates the likelihood and impacts of both salvage logging and the subsequent disturbances. In summary, salvage logging does not necessarily prevent subsequent disturbances, and sometimes it may increase disturbance likelihood and magnitude. Forecasting the suitability of salvage logging for management goals requires assessing the mechanisms through which salvage logging effects operate under local conditions, balanced with its impacts as a disturbance itself. Managing to foster the highest-priority functions and services \u2013such as biodiversity conservation, pest mitigation or economic return\u2013 across different parts of disturbed forest landscapes based on decision-making procedures such as the one proposed may constitute the best response to uncertain subsequent disturbances.",

    "volume": "11","number": "4762","abstract": "Forests are increasingly affected by natural disturbances. Subsequent salvage logging, a widespread management practice conducted predominantly to recover economic capital, produces further disturbance and impacts biodiversity worldwide. Hence, naturally disturbed forests are among the most threatened habitats in the world, with consequences for their associated biodiversity. However, there are no evidence-based benchmarks for the proportion of area of naturally disturbed forests to be excluded from salvage logging to conserve biodiversity. We apply a mixed rarefaction/extrapolation approach to a global multi-taxa dataset from disturbed forests, including birds, plants, insects and fungi, to close this gap. We find that 75\u2009±\u20097% (mean\u2009±\u2009SD) of a naturally disturbed area of a forest needs to be left unlogged to maintain 90% richness of its unique species, whereas retaining 50% of a naturally disturbed forest unlogged maintains 73\u2009±\u200912% of its unique species richness. These values do not change with the time elapsed since disturbance but vary considerably among taxonomic groups.",

    "volume": "20","number": "3","pages": "433-445","abstract": "How flooding regimes shape temperate-zone butterfly communities has received little attention. At the river Danube in eastern Austria, a levee has largely interrupted natural river dynamics since the late nineteenth century. Only a fraction of the floodplain area still experiences annual summer inundations after snow-melt in the Alps. We surveyed meadow butterfly communities on either side of the levee in a year with an unusually strong flood (2013), and in a season with a weak flood typical for the region (2012). Altogether we observed 67 butterfly species. Butterfly abundance and species richness were lower on meadows with stronger flood impact, but differences were modest. In contrast, species composition differed prominently relative to flooding regime and nectar availability. Grass-feeding species tended to be rarer on flooded meadows, while Brassicaceae-feeding species were more prevalent on nutrient-rich flood-prone meadows. Highly dispersive butterflies made up a larger share on flooded meadows, whereas highly philopatric species were relatively more common at sites with little or no inundation. These results indicate that summer inundations at the river Danube act as filters for the local species composition of butterflies on floodplain meadows. Local resource availability and the differential potential of species to re-colonize meadows after catastrophic floods are likely drivers of these differences. Effects of inundations were not consistently stronger in a year of a catastrophic flood than in a normal season. Butterfly communities on non-flooded meadows had a higher regional conservation value.",

However, systematic analyses identifying the share of the regional species pool that can take advantage of this opportunity are missing. We assessed the importance of such forest openings for open-habitat butterflies in Estonia in Northern Europe by comparing butterfly species richness and composition in forest clear-cuts with their regional species pool. The species richness of butterflies in clear-cuts appeared to be remarkably high: we recorded altogether 81% of the total regional species pool across the study sites. Clear-cuts were inhabited by a very high share (79%) of regionally occurring grassland species, as well as nearly complete sets of open-habitat generalists and forest species. Redundancy analysis showed that clear-cuts in forests with different environmental characteristics harbour distinct butterfly assemblages, their contribution to the butterfly fauna in forest landscapes being thus complementary. This as well as several other lines of evidence indicate that most butterfly species can form resident populations in harvested forest landscapes. Our findings demonstrate that considering novel types of forest openings as \u2018temporary meadows\u2019 can substantially improve the conservation prospects for butterflies and other organisms that have traditionally been considered to inhabit grasslands and other open habitats in agricultural landscapes. Human-altered ecosystems may thus prove to be a viable alternative where restoring or maintaining natural and semi-natural habitats is impossible.",

At a time of drastic decline of natural and seminatural grasslands, contemporary production forests provide various novel types of open spaces (clear-cuts, power line corridors, etc.) that are potentially suitable habitats for many grassland species, such as butterflies. On the other hand, grassland butterflies are known to perceive forest as a dispersal barrier, potentially limiting the utility of such alternative habitats. We evaluated the role of dispersal limitation in structuring local butterfly assemblages in conventionally managed forest landscapes in which clear-cutting generates varyingly isolated transient open habitats within the forest matrix. We compared butterfly species richness and composition in clear-cuts at opposite ends of a connectivity gradient: sites completely surrounded by forest (isolated clear-cuts) vs. sites connected to the network of other forest clearings by open corridors (non-isolated clear-cuts). We found only a slight difference in the species richness between isolated and non-isolated clear-cuts, both when all open-habitat species and when the subset of grassland species was compared. The frequencies of individual butterfly species in isolated and non-isolated sites were strongly correlated, regardless of their presumed dispersal ability. Our results indicate that, in large areas of production forests in Northern Europe, the formation of local butterfly assemblages is not significantly limited by dispersal. This study contributes to emerging evidence that open spaces in managed forest landscapes can be regarded as alternative habitat for a substantial share of species traditionally considered to be associated with grasslands.",

We have recently shown that local butterfly assemblages in forest openings are shaped by environmental filtering rather than dispersal limitation. However, at the level of individual movements, forest is known to form dispersal barrier for open-habitat butterflies---routine movements associated with resource exploitation do not result in dispersal in such landscapes. Typically, clear-cuts are varyingly surrounded by forest, meaning that movements between them and colonisation of newly created clear-cuts often require crossing hard boundaries between open habitat and matrix. Butterflies making such dispersal decisions may not be a random sample of individuals from the population. We used this semi-experimental landscape configuration with distinct habitat patches and matrix to examine if dispersal decisions are associated with special morphological phenotypes. Contrary to expectations, we found no significant associations between flight morphology and realised dispersal decisions---colonisers of isolated clear-cuts (fully surrounded by forest) did not differ from individuals of surrounding non-isolated habitats in any of measured wing traits. The differences in flight morphology between contrasting sites were negligible in all species and there were no consistent differences between males and females. As a possible interpretation, we link our findings to frequent, deterministic events of habitat loss and formation in forests managed by clear-cutting which may imply that virtually all phenotypes in such landscapes represent ``dispersal phenotypes''.",

    "volume": "291","pages": "108066","abstract": "More frequent and severe disturbances increasingly open the forest canopy and initiate tree regeneration. Simultaneously, increasing weather extremes, such as drought and heat, are threatening species adapted to cool and moist climate. The magnitude of the microclimatic buffering capacity of forest canopies to mitigate hot and dry weather conditions and its disturbance-induced reduction remains poorly quantified. Also, the influence of disturbance legacies (e.g., deadwood) on forest microclimate is unresolved. In a unique manipulation experiment we investigated (i) the microclimatic buffering capacity of forest canopies in years with different climatic conditions; (ii) the impacts of spatial disturbance patterns on surface light and microclimate; and (iii) the effect of deadwood presence and type on microclimate. Treatments included two disturbance patterns (i.e., aggregated and distributed), four deadwood types (i.e., standing, downed, standing and downed, removed), and one untreated control (i.e., nine treatments in total), replicated at five sites dominated by European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) in southeastern Germany. We measured forest floor light conditions and derived diurnal extremes and variation in temperature (T) and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) during four consecutive summer seasons (2016 \u2013 2019). The buffering capacity of intact forest canopies was higher in warm and dry years. Surface light was significantly higher in spatially aggregated disturbance gaps compared to distributed disturbances of similar severity. An increase in surface light by 10 % relative to closed canopies elevated Tmax and VPDmax by 0.42°C and 0.04 kPa, respectively. Deadwood presence and type did not affect the forest microclimate significantly. Microclimatic buffering under forest canopies can dampen the effects of climate change. However, increasing canopy disturbances result in more light penetrating the canopy, reducing the microclimatic buffering capacity of forests. We conclude that forest management should foster microclimatic buffering in forests as one element of a multi-pronged strategy to counter climate change.",

    "abstract": "Aim: The protection of phylogenetic diversity has become a priority in conservation biology, but its achievement requires a detailed understanding of (a) hotspots of phylogenetic diversity on a management-relevant scale and (b) the land use and climate factors determining local phylogenetic diversity. In this study, we identified spatial patterns of taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity and their environmental drivers.\r\nLocation: Bavaria, Germany.\r\nMethods: To map the cross-taxon phylogenetic diversity, we combined species distribution data obtained from country-wide monitoring programmes and phylogenetic trees of birds, bats, dragonflies, grasshoppers and butterflies and calculated the phylogenetic diversity standardized by species richness. Generalized additive models were used to test the effects of land use and climate on phylogenetic diversity. We identified hotspots of phylogenetic diversity and assessed the extent to which established protected areas in Bavaria cover these hotspots.\r\nResults: High coverage by urban areas, arable land and water bodies negatively affected the phylogenetic diversity of most species groups. The phylogenetic diversity of birds increased with increasing meadow cover. Climate did not influence the phylogenetic diversity of the studied groups. We identified 10 regional hotspots that contained the highest standardized phylogenetic diversity across the examined species groups. There was a strong mismatch between hotspots of phylogenetic diversity among the species groups. Protected areas (national parks, natural reserves\r\nand areas of the Flora-Fauna-Habitat Directive) overlapped only to ~9.6% with these hotspots of standardized phylogenetic diversity.\r\nMain conclusions: Cross-taxon approaches are required to identify hotspots of phylogenetic diversity at a management-relevant scale. At regional scales, land use was more important than climate in determining phylogenetic diversity. Our study highlights the importance of involving land users into strategies for protecting phylogenetic diversity.",

    "abstract": "The evolutionary split between gymnosperms and angiosperms has far\u2010reaching implications for the current communities colonizing trees. The inherent characteristics of dead wood include its role as a spatially scattered habitat of plant tissue, transient in time. Thus, local assemblages in deadwood forming a food web in a necrobiome should be affected not only by dispersal ability but also by host tree identity, the decay stage and local abiotic conditions. However, experiments simultaneously manipulating these potential community drivers in deadwood are lacking. To disentangle the importance of spatial distance and microclimate, as well as host identity and decay stage as drivers of local assemblages, we conducted two consecutive experiments, a 2\u2010tree species and 6\u2010tree species experiment with 80 and 72 tree logs, respectively, located in canopy openings and under closed canopies of a montane and a lowland forest. We sampled saproxylic beetles, spiders, fungi and bacterial assemblages from logs. Variation partitioning for community metrics based on a unified framework of Hill numbers showed consistent results for both studies: host identity was most important for sporocarp\u2010detected fungal assemblages, decay stage and host tree for DNA\u2010detected fungal assemblages, microclimate and decay stage for beetles and spiders, and decay stage for bacteria. Spatial distance was of minor importance for most taxa but showed the strongest effects for arthropods. The contrasting patterns among the taxa highlight the need for multi\u2010taxon analyses in identifying the importance of abiotic and biotic drivers of community composition. Moreover, the consistent finding of microclimate as the primary driver for saproxylic beetles compared to host identity shows, for the first time that existing evolutionary host adaptions can be outcompeted by local climate conditions in deadwood.",

    "abstract": "1. The enrichment of deadwood is essential for the conservation of saproxylic biodiversity in managed forests. However, existing strategies focus on a cost\u2010intensive increase of deadwood amount, while largely neglecting increasing deadwood diversity.\r\n2. Deadwood objects, i.e. logs and branches, from six tree species were experimentally sun\u2010exposed, canopy\u2010shaded, and artificially shaded for four years, after which the alpha\u2010, beta\u2010, and gamma\u2010diversity of saproxylic beetles, wood\u2010inhabiting fungi, and spiders were analyzed. Analyses of beta\u2010diversity included the spatial distance between exposed deadwood objects. A random\u2010drawing procedure was used to identify the combination of tree species and sun exposure that yielded the highest gamma\u2010diversity at a minimum of exposed deadwood amount.\r\n3. In sun\u2010exposed plots, species numbers in logs were higher than in shaded plots for all taxa, while in branches we observed the opposite for saproxylic beetles. Tree species affected the species numbers only of saproxylic beetles and wood\u2010inhabiting fungi. The beta\u2010diversity of saproxylic beetles and wood\u2010inhabiting\u2010fungi among logs was influenced by sun exposure and tree species, but beta\u2010diversity of spiders by sun exposure only. For all saproxylic taxa recorded in logs, differences between communities increased with increasing spatial distance.\r\n4. A combination of canopy\u2010shaded Populus logs and sun\u2010exposed Carpinus logs resulted in the highest species numbers of all investigated saproxylic taxa among all possible combinations of tree species and sun\u2010exposure treatments.\r\n5. Synthesis and applications. We recommend incorporating the enrichment of different tree species and particularly the variation in sun exposure into existing strategies of deadwood enrichment. Based on the results of our study, we suggest to combine logs of softwood broadleaf tree species (e.g. Carpinus, Populus), hardwood broadleaf tree species (e.g. Quercus) and coniferous tree species (e.g. Pinus) under different conditions of sun exposure and distribute them spatially in a landscape to maximize the beneficial effects on overall diversity.",

    "volume": "11","number": "4","abstract": "Carrion plays an essential role in shaping the structure and functioning of ecosystems and has far\u2010reaching implications for biodiversity conservation. The change in availability and type of carcasses throughout ecosystems can involve negative effects for scavenging communities. To address this issue, there have been recent conservation management measures of carrion provision in natural systems. However, the optimal conditions under which exposing carcasses to optimize conservation outcomes are still limited. Here, we used camera traps throughout elevational and vegetational gradients to monitor the consumption of 48 deer carcasses over a study period of six years by evaluating 270,279 photographs resulting out of 15,373 trap nights. We detected 17 species visiting carcass deployments, including five endangered species. Our results show that large carcasses, the winter season, and a heterogeneous surrounding habitat enhanced the frequency of carcass visits and the species richness of scavenger assemblages. Contrary to our expectations, carcass species, condition (fresh/frozen), and provision schedule (continuous vs single exposure) did not influence scavenging frequency or diversity. The carcass visitation frequency increased with carcass mass and lower temperatures. The effect of large carcasses was especially pronounced for mesopredators and the Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx). Lynx were not too influenced in its carrion acquisition by the season, but exclusively preferred remote habitats containing higher forest cover. Birds of prey, mesopredators, and top predators were also positively influenced by the visiting rate of ravens (Corvus corax), whereas no biotic or abiotic preferences were found for wild boars (Sus scrofa). This study provides evidence that any ungulate species of carrion, either in a fresh or in previously frozen condition, attracts a high diversity of scavengers especially during winter, thereby supporting earlier work that carcass provisions may support scavenger communities and endangered species.",

The class of measures is parameterized by an order q\u2009≥\u20090 to control for sensitivity to species relative abundances. When q = 0, species abundances are disregarded and our measure reduces to the conventional measure of completeness, that is, the ratio of the observed species richness to the true richness (observed plus undetected). When q = 1, our measure reduces to the sample coverage (the proportion of the total number of individuals in the entire assemblage that belongs to detected species), a concept developed by Alan Turing in his cryptographic analysis. The sample completeness of a general order q\u2009≥\u20090 extends Turing's sample coverage and quantifies the proportion of the assemblage's individuals belonging to detected species, with each individual being proportionally weighted by the (q\u2009−\u20091)th power of its abundance. We propose the use of a continuous profile depicting our proposed measures with respect to q\u2009≥\u20090 to characterize the sample completeness of a survey. An analytic estimator of the diversity profile and its sampling uncertainty based on a bootstrap method are derived and tested by simulations. To compare diversity across multiple assemblages, we propose an integrated approach based on the framework of Hill numbers to assess (a) the sample completeness profile, (b) asymptotic diversity estimates to infer true diversities of entire assemblages, (c) non\u2010asymptotic standardization via rarefaction and extrapolation, and (d) an evenness profile. Our framework can be extended to incidence data. Empirical data sets from several research fields are used for illustration.",

    "abstract": "The expected future intensification of forest disturbance as a consequence of ongoing anthropogenic climate change highlights the urgent need to more robustly quantify associated biotic responses. Saproxylic beetles are a diverse group of forest invertebrates representing a major component of biodiversity that is associated with the decomposition and cycling of wood nutrients and carbon in forest ecosystems. Disturbance-induced declines or shifts in their diversity indicate the loss of key ecological and/or morphological species traits that could change ecosystem functioning. Functional and phylogenetic diversity of biological communities is commonly used to link species communities to ecosystem functions. However, our knowledge on how disturbance intensity alters functional and phylogenetic diversity of saproxylic beetles is incomplete. Here, we analyzed the main drivers of saproxylic beetle abundance and diversity using a comprehensive dataset from montane primary forests in Europe. We investigated cascading relationships between 250 years of historical disturbance mechanisms, forest structural attributes and the taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional diversity of present-day beetle communities. Our analyses revealed that historical disturbances have significant effects on current beetle communities. Contrary to our expectations, different aspects of beetle communities, that is, abundance, taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional diversity, responded to different disturbance regime components. Past disturbance frequency was the most important component influencing saproxylic beetle communities and habitat via multiple temporal and spatial pathways. The quantity of deadwood and its diameter positively influenced saproxylic beetle abundance and functional diversity, whereas phylogenetic diversity was positively influenced by canopy openness. Analyzing historical disturbances, we observed that current beetle diversity is far from static, such that the importance of various drivers might change during further successional development. Only forest landscapes that are large enough to allow for the full range of temporal and spatial patterns of disturbances and post-disturbance development will enable long-term species coexistence and their associated ecosystem functions.",

Lentic freshwater organisms are influenced by a multitude of factors, including geomorphology, hydrology, anthropogenic impacts and climate change. Organisms that depend on patchy resources such as water beetles may also be sensitive to anthropogenic habitat degradation, like pollution, eutrophication, water level or management alteration.\r\n2. To assess composition and ecological trends in the water beetle communities of Central Europe, we sampled water beetles (Dytiscidae, Haliplidae, Noteridae) in 33 water bodies in Southern Germany from 1991 to 2018. We used manual, time\u2010standardised capture during three periods: between 1991 and 1995, 2007 and 2008, and 2017 and 2018.\r\n3. During the 28\u2010year survey period, we captured a total of 81 species. We found annual declines in both species number (ca −1%) and abundance (ca −2%). Also, community composition showed significant changes over time. The significant impact of pH on the community composition suggests that the recorded changes through time partly reflect natural succession processes. However, a pronounced decline of beetle species belonging to the moor\u2010related beetle associations indicated that Central European water beetles are also threatened by non\u2010successional factors, including desiccation, increased nitrogen input and/or mineralisation, and the loss of specific habitats. This trend to physiographical homogenisation resulted in corresponding community composition shifts.\r\n4. To effectively protect endangered species, conservation strategies need to be aimed at regularly creating new water bodies with mineralic bottom substratum, and maintenance of moor water bodies that represent late successional stages.",

    "volume": "260","pages": "110068","abstract": "1. Primary objectives of national parks usually include both, the protection of natural processes and species conservation. When these objectives conflict, as occurs because of the cascading effects of large mammals (i.e., ungulates and large carnivores) on lower trophic levels, park managers have to decide upon the appropriate management while considering various local circumstances. 2. To analyse if ungulate management strategies are in accordance with the objectives defined for protected areas, we assessed the current status of ungulate management across European national parks using the naturalness concept and identified the variables that influence the management. 3. We collected data on ungulate management from 209 European national parks in 29 countries by means of a large-scale questionnaire survey. Ungulate management in the parks was compared by creating two naturalness scores. The first score reflects ungulate and large carnivore species compositions, and the second evaluates human intervention on ungulate populations. We then tested whether the two naturalness score categories are influenced by the management objectives, park size, years since establishment, percentage of government-owned land, and human impact on the environment (human influence index) using two generalized additive mixed models. 4. In 67.9% of the national parks, wildlife is regulated by culling (40.2%) or hunting (10.5%) or both (17.2%). Artificial feeding occurred in 81.3% of the national parks and only 28.5% of the national parks had a non-intervention zone covering at least 75% of the area. Furthermore, ungulate management differed greatly among the different countries, likely because of differences in hunting traditions and cultural and political backgrounds. Ungulate management was also influenced by park size, human impact on the landscape, and national park objectives, but after removing these variables from the full model the reduced models only showed a small change in the deviance explained. In areas with higher anthropogenic pressure, wildlife diversity tended to be lower and a higher number of domesticated species tended to be present. Human intervention (culling and artificial feeding) was lower in smaller national parks and when park objectives followed those set by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN). 5. Our study shows that many European national parks do not fulfil the aims of protected area management as set by IUCN guidelines. In contrast to the USA and Canada, Europe currently has no common ungulate management policy within national parks. This lack of a common policy together with differences in species composition, hunting traditions, and cultural or political context has led to differences in ungulate management among European countries. To fulfil the aims and objectives of national parks and to develop ungulate management strategies further, we highlight the importance of creating a more integrated European ungulate management policy to meet the aims of national parks.",

We focused on anlyse the functional trait patterns and functional diversity components of two main assemblages that were collected with window traps (WTs) and hollow emergence traps (HETs) respectively, between three protected areas of the Iberian Peninsula. For that we measured phenological, physiological, morphological, and ecological traits. Results showed that the main microhabitats exploited by each assemblage (WT and HET) constrain most of the morphological traits and trophic guilds. In addition, relative elytra length and predator guild, together with adult activity period, responded to differences at the habitat level (among study areas). HET assemblages were less taxonomically diverse but more functionally diverse than those of WTs, enhancing the functional relevance of tree hollows. Additionally, niche filtering dominated WT assemblages, which were characterised by a narrower functional space and a higher redundancy. In contrast, in the HET assemblages the coexistence of functionally dissimilar species is driven by the niche heterogeneity. HET and WT assemblages differed in the functional space occupied by each within areas, but both assemblages reflected coincident patterns among areas that pointed to a reduction of functional space with management.",

    "abstract": "Despite decades of scientific effort, there is still no consensus on the determinants of broad-scale gradients of animal diversity. We argue that general drivers of diversity are unlikely to be found among the narrowly defined taxa which are typically analyzed in studies of broad-scale diversity gradients because ecological niches evolve largely conservatively. This causes constraints in the use of available niche space leading to systematic differences in diversity gradients among taxa. We instead advocate studies of phylogenetically diverse animal communities along broad environmental gradients. Such multi-taxa communities are less constrained in resource use and diversification and may be better targets for testing major classical hypotheses on diversity gradients. Besides increasing the spatial scale in analyses, expanding the phylogenetic coverage may be a second way to achieve higher levels of generality in studies of broad-scale diversity gradients.",

Despite its popularity, lack of information on its demography and mobility may compromise adoption of suitable conservation strategies. The beetle experienced marked retreat from NW part of its range; its single population survives N of the Alps and W of the Carpathians. The population inhabits several small patches of old beech forest on hill-tops of the Ralska Upland, Czech Republic. We performed mark-recapture study of the population and assessed its distribution pattern. Our results demonstrate the high mobility of the beetle, including dispersal between hills (up to 1.6 km). The system is thus interconnected; it contained ∼2000 adult beetles in 2008. Estimated population densities were high, ranging between 42 and 84 adult beetles/hectare a year. The population survives at a former military-training ground despite long-term isolation and low cover of mature beech forest (∼1%). Its survival could be attributed to lack of forestry activities between the 1950s and 1990s, slow succession preventing canopy closure and undergrowth expansion, and probably also to the distribution of habitat patches on conspicuous hill-tops. In order to increase chances of the population for long term survival, we propose to stop clear-cuts of old beech forests, increase semi-open beech woodlands in areas currently covered by conifer plantations and active habitat management at inhabited sites and their wider environs.",

    "volume": "50","number": "4","pages": "742-752","abstract": "A population of Eurasian lynx Lynx lynx was established by reintroductions in the Bohemian Forest Ecosystem in the 1970s and 1980s. The most recent information on the population status indicates that the distribution has stagnated since the late 1990s, for unknown reasons. We assessed the availability of suitable habitat along the Austrian\u2013German\u2013Czech border, and hypothesized that the Bohemian\u2013Bavarian lynx population is not in equilibrium with habitat suitability. Based on global positioning system data from 10 radio-collared lynx, we used a maximum entropy approach to model suitable habitat. Variables reflecting anthropogenic influence contributed most to the model and were negatively associated with the occurrence of lynx. We evaluated the model prediction using independent records of lynx from monitoring in Bavaria, Germany. Using our habitat approach we estimated the area of potential habitat, based on a mean annual home range of 445 km2 for males and 122 km2 for females. Our results indicated there were 12,415 km2 of suitable habitat, distributed among 13 patches, for a potential population of c. 142 (93\u2013160) resident lynx. We assessed connectivity via least-cost paths and found that all suitable patches could be reached by the lynx. A comparison with the current distribution of lynx, however, confirms that a significant proportion of suitable habitat is not occupied, which indicates that the distribution is limited by factors other than habitat, with illegal killing being the most likely cause. Our study provides crucial information for the development of a conservation strategy and regional planning for the Bohemian\u2013Bavarian lynx population.",

    "volume": "11","number": "8","pages": "1-18","abstract": "Prey selection is a key factor shaping animal populations and evolutionary dynamics. An optimal forager should target prey that offers the highest benefits in terms of energy content at the lowest costs. Predators are therefore expected to select for prey of optimal size. Stalking predators do not pursue their prey long, which may lead to a more random choice of prey individuals. Due to difficulties in assessing the composition of available prey populations, data on prey selection of stalking carnivores are still scarce. We show how the stalking predator Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) selects prey individuals based on species identity, age, sex and individual behaviour. To address the difficulties in assessing prey population structure, we confirm inferred selection patterns by using two independent data sets: (1) data of 387 documented kills of radio-collared lynx were compared to the prey population structure retrieved from systematic camera trapping using Manly\u2019s standardized selection ratio alpha and (2) data on 120 radio-collared roe deer were analysed using a Cox proportional hazards model. Among the larger red deer prey, lynx selected against adult males\u2014the largest and potentially most dangerous prey individuals. In roe deer lynx preyed selectively on males and did not select for a specific age class. Activity during high risk periods reduced the risk of falling victim to a lynx attack. Our results suggest that the stalking predator lynx actively selects for size, while prey behaviour induces selection by encounter and stalking success rates.",

    "volume": "89","number": "1","pages": "69-81","abstract": "Estimating forest structural attributes is one of the essential forestry-related remote sensing applications. The methods applied so far typically concentrate on the structure of the overstorey. For various conservation and management applications, however, information on lower layers is also of great interest. Detecting understorey cover by remote sensing is challenging, as passive sensors do not penetrate to the forest ground layer. An alternative to these is 3D metrics from active light detection and ranging (LiDAR). Here, we evaluate this technique for describing the vegetation density of multiple stand layers within the temperate stands of a large protected area in south-eastern Germany. We combined LiDAR metrics and information on forest habitat types with regression models to investigate LiDAR metrics that are significantly correlated with vegetation density. The top canopy and the herbal layer showed strong correlations with the applied LiDAR metrics, whereas the predictive power was lower for the intermediate stand layers. Moreover, our results suggest that the relationship between LiDAR predictors and vegetation density depends on the forest type. A comparison of the regression models with random forest predictions showed no major improvement in predictive error. In conclusion, this study highlights the value of the LiDAR metrics for characterizing the structural properties of lower forest layers, which has implications for wildlife and forest management applications, especially in protected areas.",

    "volume": "24","number": "12","pages": "2935-2952","abstract": "A tool commonly used in wildlife biology is density estimation via camera-trap monitoring coupled with capture--recapture analysis. Reliable regional density estimations of animal populations are required as a basis for management decisions. However, these estimations are affected by the session design, such as the length of the monitoring session, season, and number of trap sites. This method is regularly used to monitor Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) which mostly occupy the forested mountain ranges in Central Europe. Here we used intensive field sampling data of a major Central European lynx population to investigate (1) the optimal monitoring session length considering the trade-off between population closure and number of recaptures for density estimates, (2) the optimal time window within the year considering the stability of density estimates, detection probability, recapture number, and reproduction, and (3) the number of trap sites and trap spacing required to achieve robust density estimates. Using two closure tests, we found that 80 days are the minimum to ensure adequate data quality. A spatially explicit capture--recapture model revealed the best monitoring period to be late summer to early winter. Based on our results, we recommend for similar management units of comparable size (˜300 km2) and similar recapture numbers to sample for at least 80 days in autumn with traps spaced about every 2.5--3 km. Our results also indicated that stable density estimates could still be maintained when the sampling area is enlarged to 760 km2 with trap spacing every 5--6 km if session lengths are increased.",

Two large, contiguous national parks (one in Germany and one in the Czech Republic) form the centre of the area, are surrounded by private hunting grounds, and hunting regulations in each country differ. Here we aimed at unravelling the influence of management-related and environmental factors on the distribution of red deer (Cervus elaphus) and roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) in this ecosystem. We used the standing crop method based on counts of pellet groups, with point counts every 100 m along 218 randomly distributed transects. Our analysis, which accounted for overdispersion as well as zero inflation and spatial autocorrelation, corroborated the view that both human management and the physical and biological environment drive ungulate distribution in mountainous areas in Central Europe. In contrast to our expectations, protection by national parks was the least important variable for red deer and the third important out of four variables for roe deer; protection negatively influenced roe deer distribution in both parks and positively influenced red deer distribution in Germany. Country was the most influential variable for both red and roe deer, with higher counts of pellet groups in the Czech Republic than in Germany. Elevation, which indicates increasing environmental harshness, was the second most important variable for both species. Forest cover was the least important variable for roe deer and the third important variable for red deer; the relationship for roe deer was positive and linear, and optimal forest cover for red deer was about 70% within a 500 m radius. Our results have direct implications for the future conservation management of deer in protected areas in Central Europe and show in particular that large non-intervention zones may not cause agglomerations of deer that could lead to conflicts along the border of protected, mountainous areas.",

Unfortunately, monitoring species assemblages is costly, mainly due to the time spent on identification. Excluding families which are rich in specimens and species but are difficult to identify is a frequent procedure used in ecological entomology to reduce the identification cost. The Staphylinidae (rove beetle) family is both one of the most frequently excluded and one of the most species-rich saproxylic beetle families. Using a large-scale beetle and environmental dataset from 238 beech stands across Europe, we evaluated the effects of staphylinid exclusion on results in ecological forest studies. Simplified staphylinid-excluded assemblages were found to be relevant surrogates for whole assemblages. The species richness and composition of saproxylic beetle assemblages both with and without staphylinids responded congruently to landscape, climatic and stand gradients, even when the assemblages included a high proportion of staphylinid species. At both local and regional scales, the species richness as well as the species composition of staphylinid-included and staphylinid-excluded assemblages were highly positively correlated. Ranking of sites according to their biodiversity level, which either included or excluded Staphylinidae in species richness, also gave congruent results. From our results, species assemblages omitting staphylinids can be taken as efficient surrogates for complete assemblages in large scale biodiversity monitoring studies.",

However, field studies under heterogeneous environmental conditions remain rare. In the present study, we investigated the genetic constitution of 121 mature oak host trees at different trophic levels from 10 sites across Bavaria, southern Germany and their associated insect communities. A total of 23,576 individuals representing 395 species of beetles and true bugs were evaluated. In particular, we determined whether the composition of arthropod communities is related to the oak genotype and whether the strength of the relationships decreases from lower to higher trophic levels, such as for phytophagous, xylophagous, zoophagous, and mycetophagous species. The genetic differentiation of oaks was assessed using eight microsatellite markers. We found no significant influence of the oak genotype on neither the full beetle and true bug community nor on any of the analyzed trophic guilds. In contrast, the community composition of the insects was highly related to the space and climate, such that the community similarity decreased with increases in spatial distance and climatic differences. The relationship with space and climate was much stronger in beetles than in true bugs, particularly in mycetophagous species. Our results suggest that spatial processes override the genetic effects of the host plant in structuring arthropod communities on oak trees. Because we used neutral markers, we cannot exclude the possibility that trait-specific markers may reveal a genetic imprint of the foundation tree species on the composition of the arthropod community. However, based on the strength of the spatial patterns in our data set, we assume that genetic differences among oaks are less important in the structuring of arthropod communities. Future whole-genome studies are required to draw a final conclusion.",

As environmental change modifies also biodiversity it is unclear whether direct effects of environmental factors on ecosystem processes are more important than indirect effects mediated by changes in biodiversity. High-quality resources like carrion occur as heterogeneous pulses of energy and nutrients. Consequently, the distribution of scavenging insects is related to resource availability. Therefore, carrion decomposition represents a suitable process from which to unravel direct effects of environmental change from indirect biodiversity-related effects on ecosystem processes. During three field seasons in 2010 we exposed traps baited with small-mammal carrion at 21 sites along a temperature gradient to explore the insect carrion fauna and decomposition rate in the Bohemian Forest, Germany. The abundance component of beetle and fly assemblages decreased with decreasing temperature. Independently, the composition component of both taxa changed with temperature and season. The change in the composition component of beetles depicted a loss of larger species at higher temperatures. Decomposition rate did not change directly along the temperature gradient but was directly influenced by season. The composition component of beetles, and to a small extent of flies, but not their abundance component, directly affected carrion decomposition. Consequently, lower decomposition rates at lower temperatures can be explained by the absence of larger beetle species. Thus, we predict that future environmental change will modify carrion fauna composition and thereby indirectly decomposition rate. Moreover, reorganizations of the insect carrion composition will directly translate into modified decomposition rates, with potential consequences for nutrient availability and carbon storage.",

Here we aimed to present a comprehensive picture of community composition and seasonal dynamics of carabid beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae) in broad-leaved Korean pine mixed forest in Northeast China, which harbors a large diversity. We sampled 23,336 individuals from 14 genera and 39 species with pitfall traps over more than 1 year in a 25-ha plot. The six most abundant species accounted for 76.65 \\% of all individuals. Species estimations for the 25 ha plot ranged from 40 to 45 species. Overall abundance, species diversity, community composition, and abundance of individual species varied seasonally. Most of the abundant species showed an activity pattern of single peak, and were most active between July and early September. Few species showed a bimodal seasonal activity pattern. Both temperature and precipitation significantly influenced the carabid community within a year. Hierarchical clustering indicated that carabid communities of ten consecutive sampling periods could be partitioned into three time-windows, respectively, corresponding with warm temperature-high rainfall season, warm temperature-low rainfall season, and cool and cold season. By using the extended method of indicator species analysis, 11 indicator species were identified for the three time-groups and their combinations, suggesting the existence of temporal niche partitioning among carabid species. We suggest that intra-annual patterns of carabid abundance and species composition can be explained by species responses to seasonal changes in hydrothermal conditions. Cost-effective sampling effort to assess native carabid diversity and assemblage was also discussed in this study.",

No genetic information on this species is available that could provide a basis for ongoing conservation and breeding programs. Here, we genetically analyzed wild and captive populations of European Ural Owls to provide data that can be used to establish sound and sustainable management strategies. We analyzed mitochondrial and nuclear markers to evaluate the morphology-based concept of two subspecies (Strix uralensis liturata and Strix uralensis macroura), to gain insights into the phylogeographic population structure, and to determine genetic clusters for management implications. Our results supported neither the morphological subspecies concept nor a strong phylogeographic population structure. However, they pointed toward a noteworthy genetic exchange in the western range of the distribution of this species. Structure analysis revealed five genetic clusters. We propose that genetic-cluster-based management is better suited to the conservation of European Ural Owls than the separate consideration of each local population. If applied in supportive breeding programs, genetic cluster recognition and its contribution to divergence and diversity would help to preserve the genetic variability of the captive breeding population and enable optimal genetic tuning of the captive population to correspond to the genetic constitution of the supported population.",

One of the flagship species in European wildlife conservation is the forest-dwelling capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus), where several populations are endangered. In the Bohemian Forest, e.g., the population severely declined 30 years ago with only 100 birds remaining in 1985. Subsequently, breeding and release programs were conducted to supplement the local population. The current distribution and population size, however, remained unknown. With recent habitat changes and increasing recreational activities, a reliable population estimate to inform conservation plans was needed. A team of scientists and volunteers collected fresh capercaillie droppings covering an area of about 120,000 ha. We genotyped ten microsatellite loci to estimate the current population size and to determine the population's spatial and genetic structure. Population size and density estimators revealed a population size of approximately 500 individuals, which is thus one of the two largest relict populations in the low mountain ranges of temperate Europe. The population clustering revealed gene flow across the entire study area. Several genotypes were documented with multiple recaptures at spatial distances between 10 and 30 km additionally corroborating gene flow across the entire landscape of the study area. Males were more closely related than females on small spatial scales up to 3 km, indicating lower dispersal rates in males. We conclude that the population currently appears to have a viable size and shows unrestricted gene flow across state borders and management units of the entire Bohemian Forest. However, long-term viability of this population requires a transboundary strategy to sustainably protect and monitor this isolated capercaillie population in Central Europe.",

Understanding whether human activity similarly affects the distribution of species beyond habitat suitability is crucial but difficult to assess for conservation managers. Here, we assessed the effect of recreation and forestry activity on a threatened forest-dwelling umbrella species, the Capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus). We followed the citizen science approach on the landscape scale in the Bohemian Forest. We analyzed species data non-invasively collected through intensive fieldwork by volunteers and assessed human activity in the entire study area by analyzing expert questionnaires. The study area extends over 119,000 ha and harbors one of the largest relict populations of this grouse species in Central European low mountain ranges. Our statistical models revealed a negative impact of recreational activities on the intensity of habitat use of the birds within suitable habitats, thereby pointing toward a landscape of fear. The influence of forestry activity, in contrast, was not clear. In comparison to existing regional tourism impact studies, we were able to elevate the examination to the landscape scale. Our results underlined the relevance of recreation in limiting the species' habitat on an entire landscape and allow us to conclude that habitat managers should set aside well-defined zones without recreational activities to preserve the refuge of this umbrella species.",

The associated loss of biological legacies, such as dead or dying trees, has exposed numerous saproxylic species to high risks of extinction. In contrast, extensive wilderness forests in Northern Mongolia have been sustained owing to significant cultural differences. Here we used saproxylic beetle abundance data gathered during two sampling campaigns in the Mongolian taiga to address whether (1) the saproxylic beetle fauna of the Mongolian taiga is comparable to that of European boreal forests, (2) fires are a natural disturbance regime, indicated by the occurrence of many pyrophilous species, and (3) species rare in Europe are also rare in the Northern Mongolian wilderness. Of 191 saproxylic beetle species identified, 150 (79 \\%) were also found in Europe. The high number of pyrophilous beetle species (20) indicated that natural species communities are well adapted to this disturbance regime. The species rarity in Germany was significantly positively correlated with the species rarity in Finland, but the species rarity in these two countries was negatively correlated with that in the Mongolian wilderness. Our results indicated that wilderness areas with natural disturbances provide biological legacies important for rare species. Therefore, exploitation of the unique, remaining natural landscapes of the Palaearctic wilderness areas should be stopped. Moreover, we urge conservationists to expand controlled burning for restoration at relict sites of rare boreal species also outside Fennoscandia.",

    "volume": "8","number": "6","pages": "1-6","abstract": "Along elevational gradients, climate warming may lead to an upslope shift of the lower and upper range margin of organisms. A recent meta-analysis concluded that these shifts are species specific and considerably differ among taxonomic lineages. We used the opportunity to compare upper range margins of five lineages (plants, beetles, flies, hymenoptera, and birds) between 1902\u20131904 and 2006\u20132007 within one region (Bavarian Forest, Central Europe). Based on the increase in the regional mean annual temperature during this period and the regional lapse rate, the upslope shift is expected to be between 51 and 201 m. Averaged across species within lineages, the range margin of all animal lineages shifted upslope, but that of plants did not. For animals, the observed shifts were probably due to shifts in temperature and not to changes in habitat conditions. The range margin of plants is therefore apparently not constrained by temperature, a result contrasting recent findings. The mean shift of birds (165 m) was within the predicted range and consistent with a recent global meta-analysis. However, the upslope shift of the three insect lineages (>260 m) exceeded the expected shift even after considering several sources of uncertainty, which indicated a non-linear response to temperature. Our analysis demonstrated broad differences among lineages in their response to climate change even within one region. Furthermore, on the considered scale, the response of ectothermic animals was not consistent with expectations based on shifts in the mean annual temperature. Irrespective of the reasons for the overshooting of the response of the insects, these shifts lead to reorganizations in the composition of assemblages with consequences for ecosystem processes.",

First, a normative model was developed centered on evidence-based knowledge about (a) forest composition, structure, and function at multiple scales, and (b) performance targets derived by quantifying the habitat amount in naturally dynamic forests, and as required for presence of populations of specialized focal species. Second, we compared the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification standards' ecological indicators from 1998 and 2010 in Sweden to the normative model using a Specific, Measurable, Accurate, Realistic, and Timebound (SMART) indicator approach. Indicator variables and targets for riparian and aquatic ecosystems were clearly under-represented compared to terrestrial ones. FSC's ecological indicators expanded over time from composition and structure towards function, and from finer to coarser spatial scales. However, SMART indicators were few. Moreover, they poorly reflected quantitative evidence-based knowledge, a consequence of the fact that forest certification mirrors the outcome of a complex social negotiation process.",

The populations of the Alps and mountain ranges are classified as the subspecies T. torquatus alpestris, and those of the northern populations as T. torquatus torquatus. Since birds are mobile when, e.g., compared to mammals of the same size, it is likely that the populations in the low mountain ranges originated from dispersal events after the last ice age. We analyzed an mtDNA fragment of Ring Ouzel museum specimens from across Europe. We found a shallow gene tree with little differentiation between the subspecies and therefore incomplete lineage sorting. However, both, subspecies as well as low mountain range populations were characterized by private alleles respectively. Furthermore, when we grouped sequenced specimens according to their origin in an alpine group, a group from the low mountain ranges, and two northern groups, we found significant differentiation between the alpine and the low mountain range group, similar to the difference between the alpine and the two northern groups. This suggests an origin of populations on the low mountain ranges similar to that of the arctic--alpine disjunction, and that these populations are remnants of a broader distribution in the past.",

We investigated the impact of bark beetle attacks and subsequent salvage logging on insectivorous bats in a temperate mountain forest. We quantified bat activity (25,373 min counts; 32 plots) using batcorders during 221 all-night surveys in stands killed by bark beetles, with dead trees removed or not, and in vital, single- or multi-layered mature forest stands. We analysed the differences in activity of all bats in general and of bats of foraging guilds (open habitat, forest edge, closed habitat) in these habitats using a generalized linear Poisson mixed model, with plot and observation as random factors, and temperature and habitat as fixed factors. Only open-habitat foragers were slightly more active in salvage-logged stands than in bark-beetle-affected stands; they generally benefited from an open forest canopy, whereas closed-habitat foragers did not. Our results indicated that: (1) bats are less affected by salvage logging after a disturbance of a magnitude typical for European forests, probably because enough roosts are present in surrounding areas, (2) habitats for open foragers are improved by bark beetle infestation and (3) bats are poor bioindicators of negative impacts of salvage logging after natural disturbance in forests with a composition typical for Central Europe.",

Open-habitat foraging bats have a wing morphology adapted for covering long distances, possibly use information transfer to locate patches of high prey abundance, and would therefore be expected to show an aggregative response at these patches. Here, we examined the effects of prey abundance on foraging activities of open-habitat foragers in comparison to that of edge-habitat foragers and closed-habitat foragers. Bat activity was estimated by counting foraging calls recorded with bat call recorders (38,371 calls). Prey abundance was estimated concurrently at each site using light and pitfall traps. The habitat was characterized by terrestrial laser scanning. Prey abundance increased with vegetation density. As expected, recordings of open-habitat foragers clearly decreased with increasing vegetation density. The foraging activity of edge- and closed-habitat foragers was not significantly affected by the vegetation density, i.e., these guilds were able to forage from open habitats to habitats with dense vegetation. Only open-habitat foragers displayed a significant and proportional aggregative response to increasing prey abundance. Our results suggest that adaptations for effective and low-cost foraging constrains habitat use and excludes the guild of open-habitat foragers from foraging in habitats with high prey abundance, such as dense forest stands.",

One challenge of these methods is the sampling of genetic material from the target species. Genetic material of various predators, such as bears, canids, and felids, has been successfully obtained from both hair trapped in snares and scat. However, there is currently no standard procedure for sampling genetic material from the Eurasian Lynx (Lynx lynx). We tested established and newly developed hair snares in two near-natural lynx enclosures in the Bavarian Forest National Park. All snares consisted of a wooden post; they differed in the type of material attached to the post for snaring hair: carpet (velour with 40 nails), wildcat (spruce wood with 2--3 mm deep, horizontal and diagonal ridges), wire brush, doormat, or rubber bands (250 g of rubber bands wrapped around the post). We determined the acceptance of the hair snares by the animals by observing their behavior with the aid of video cameras. The number of rubbing events on the different trap types did not significantly differ, but the rubbing duration was longer for the doormat hair snare. The wire brush hair snare collected the highest total amount of hair and --- beside the carpet --- the highest amount of hair per unit of time. Almost all hair trapped on the wire brush snare were retained during a 2-week exposure to the elements outside of the enclosures. The results of our study may hold for other felid species with hair characteristics similar to those of lynx.",

    "volume": "7","number": "2","pages": "1-10","abstract": "Ungulates, in particular the Central European roe deer Capreolus capreolus and the North American white-tailed deer Odocoileus virginianus, are economically and ecologically important. The two species are risk factors for deer\u2013vehicle collisions and as browsers of palatable trees have implications for forest regeneration. However, no large-scale management systems for ungulates have been implemented, mainly because of the high efforts and costs associated with attempts to estimate population sizes of free-living ungulates living in a complex landscape. Attempts to directly estimate population sizes of deer are problematic owing to poor data quality and lack of spatial representation on larger scales. We used data on 74,000 deer\u2013vehicle collisions observed in 2006 and 2009 in Bavaria, Germany, to model the local risk of deer\u2013vehicle collisions and to investigate the relationship between deer\u2013vehicle collisions and both environmental conditions and browsing intensities. An innovative modelling approach for the number of deer\u2013vehicle collisions, which allows nonlinear environment\u2013deer relationships and assessment of spatial heterogeneity, was the basis for estimating the local risk of collisions for specific road types on the scale of Bavarian municipalities. Based on this risk model, we propose a new \u201Cdeer\u2013vehicle collision index\u201D for deer management. We show that the risk of deer\u2013vehicle collisions is positively correlated to browsing intensity and to harvest numbers. Overall, our results demonstrate that the number of deer\u2013vehicle collisions can be predicted with high precision on the scale of municipalities. In the densely populated and intensively used landscapes of Central Europe and North America, a model-based risk assessment for deer\u2013vehicle collisions provides a cost-efficient instrument for deer management on the landscape scale. The measures derived from our model provide valuable information for planning road protection and defining hunting quota. Open-source software implementing the model can be used to transfer our modelling approach to wildlife\u2013vehicle collisions elsewhere.",

Conservation in spruce-dominated reserves is often contradicted by salvage logging after insect outbreaks. Here we study the community characteristics of wood decaying fungi in a high montane Norway Spruce forest with three different management types: (1) a formerly managed area disturbed by a large-scale bark beetle outbreak, (2) an area with continuous salvage logging, and (3) an old-growth forest. Bark beetle activity in the disturbed area resulted in downed wood amounts comparable to those of the old-growth forest. However, species accumulation curves for the disturbed forest were more similar to those of the logged forest than to those of the old-growth forest. This arose because of differences in the diversity of wood decay classes; wood decay in the disturbed forest was more homogeneous. Logs in the disturbed forest originated almost exclusively from bark-beetle-infested trees, but the causes of tree mortality in the old-growth forest were manifold. Although most red-listed species were clearly confined to old-growth forest, Antrodiella citrinella was most abundant in the disturbed forest. Our analysis furthermore showed that the between stand scale is the most effective unit for diversity wood-decaying fungi. We therefore suggest a conservation strategy for preserving old-growth forests and establishing protected forest stands to enhance structural heterogeneity in spruce-dominated forests. For this, a careful screening of protected areas throughout Europe is necessary to provide managers with guidelines for conservation.",

Within the concept of metacommunities, this leads to the prediction that host-plant specialists should sort into local assemblages according to the local environmental conditions, i.e. habitat conditions, whereas assemblages of host-plant generalists should depend also on regional processes. Our study aimed at ranking the importance of local environmental factors and species composition of the vegetation for predicting the species composition of phytophagous moth assemblages with either a narrow or a broad host range. Our database consists of 351,506 specimens representing 820 species of nocturnal Macrolepidoptera sampled between 1980 and 2006 using light traps in 96 strict forest reserves in southern Germany. Species were grouped as specialists or generalists according to the food plants of the larvae; specialists use host plants belonging to one genus. We used predictive canonical correspondence and co-correspondence analyses to rank the importance of local environmental factors, the species composition of the vegetation and the role of host plants for predicting the species composition of host-plant specialists and generalists. The cross-validatory fit for predicting the species composition of phytophagous moths was higher for host-plant specialists than for host-plant generalists using environmental factors as well as the composition of the vegetation. As expected for host-plant specialists, the species composition of the vegetation was a better predictor of the composition of these assemblages than the environmental variables. But surprisingly, this difference for specialized insects was not due to the occurrence of their host plants. Overall, our study supports the idea that owing to evolutionary constraints in finding a host, host-plant specialists and host-plant generalists follow two different models of metacommunities: the species-sorting and the mass-effect model.",

Current surrogates for approximating the distribution of biodiversity are habitats mapped within a number of national and international frameworks (e.g., Natura 2000), even though conventional habitat mapping is time consuming and requires well-trained personnel. Here we evaluated the use of light detection and ranging (LiDAR) to map forest habitat types to simplify the process. We used available data of habitat types for the Bavarian Forest National Park as a basis to predict habitat types with LiDAR-derived variables. Furthermore, we compared these results with predictions based on extensive ground-based climate, soil and vegetation data. Using linear and flexible discriminant analyses, we found that LiDAR is able to predict forest habitat types with the same overall accuracy as the extensive ground data for climate, soil and vegetation composition. Subtle differences in the vegetation structure between habitat types, particularly in the vertical and horizontal vegetation profiles, were captured by LiDAR. These differences in the physiognomy were in part caused by changes in altitude, which also influence tree species composition. We propose that the most-efficient way to identify forest habitat types according Natura 2000 is to combine remote-sensing LiDAR data with well-directed field surveys.",

Here we studied diversity patterns of true bugs and saproxylic beetles, sampled in 28 forest stands of southern Germany, using a hierarchical nested design of five increasingly broader spatial levels: trap location, stratum, forest stand, forest site, and ecoregion. We predicted that: (1) for large body-sized species (as a surrogate for highly mobile species) and host generalist species (low host specificity), the proportion of $\\beta$-diversity decreases from small to large spatial scales; and (2) the differences between trait-based functional guilds in the proportion of $\\beta$-diversity increase with increasing weighting of more-abundant species. Our results indicated that the ecoregion level is the most important diversity scale for both taxa and among functional guilds sampled, followed by the forest stand level. Specialized species were more strongly affected on the ecoregion level than generalist species. Differences in the proportion of $\\beta$-diversity between functional guilds increased with increasing weighting of abundant species. The $\\beta$-diversity patterns based on body size and host specificity were similar for true bugs, but partly contrasting for saproxylic beetles. Our results suggest that (1) future conservation schemes should focus on establishing new conservation sites in new ecoregions, rather than on enlarging existing protected areas; (2) host specificity might be a more meaningful trait than body size to be considered in biodiversity studies; and (3) common conservation approaches restricted to only large, conspicuous, but rare species might result in a mismatch of important biodiversity scales.",

Plants were recorded on 273 plots along four straight transects. The composition of the plant species and their environmental correlates were detected using unconstrained correspondence analysis (DCA) with post-hoc correlation of axes against site variables. We tested the effect of site variables on species composition using maximally selected rank statistics, which allow the simultaneous identification of a threshold and assessment of its significance. Species turnover within the vascular plant community along the altitudinal gradient was assessed using the same method on the basis of the DCA sample scores. Using geostatistical models of local temperature and Bayesian methods with binomial errors that account for spatial structure, we tested the influence of temperature on selected single vascular plant species and assessed the suitability of the species as climate change indicators. Temperature was the most important factor explaining the variability in vascular plant community composition, which changed discretely along the altitudinal gradient, with a climate-sensitive zone found between 1,100 and 1,200 m a.s.l. The distribution of ten species with their lower or upper altitudinal limit in this zone was significantly driven by temperature. To track vegetation responses to climate change effectively, we suggest a three-level monitoring program, flexible with regard to the volume of required sampling effort.",

Here, we present various aspects of dead-wood threshold values. We review published and unpublished dead-wood threshold data from European lowland beech--oak, mixed-montane, and boreo-alpine spruce--pine forests separately to provide managers of European forests with a baseline for management decisions for their specific forest type. Our review of dead-wood threshold data from European forests revealed 36 critical values with ranges of 10--80 m3 ha−1 for boreal and lowland forests and 10--150 m3 ha−1 for mixed-montane forests, with peak values at 20--30 m3 ha−1 for boreal coniferous forests, 30--40 m3 ha−1 for mixed-montane forests, and 30--50 m3 ha−1 for lowland oak--beech forests. We then expand the focus of dead-wood threshold analyses to community composition. We exemplify the two major statistical methods applied in ecological threshold analysis to stimulate forest researchers to analyze more of their own data with a focus on thresholds. Finally, we discuss further directions of dead-wood threshold analysis. We anticipate that further investigations of threshold values will provide a more comprehensive picture of critical ranges for dead wood, which is urgently needed for an ecological and sustainable forestry.",

Sampling of 127 trees with cavities revealed 39 trees in which O. eremita was present and for which submission of a report is mandatory. A total of 35 species was found, including 17 species in the German red data book as well as six species which are classified as relict species of ancient woodland.

As a result of the `wilding' concept implemented in the National Park Bavarian Forest, this area is one of the refuges for the species in Germany. Even though the effects of prevailing processes make the situation there particularly interesting, no recent investigation about habitat selection in the rapidly changing environment of the national park has been undertaken. We modelled the species--habitat relationship to derive the important habitat features in the national park as well as factors and critical threshold for monitoring, and to evaluate the predictive power of models based on field surveys compared to an analysis of infrared aerial photographs. We conducted our surveys on 49 plots of 25 ha each where Hazel Grouse was recorded and on an equally sized set of plots with no grouse occurrence, and used this dataset to build a predictive habitat-suitability model using logistic regression with backward stepwise variable selection. Habitat heterogeneity, stand structure, presence of mountain ash and willow, root plates, forest aisles, and young broadleaf stands proved to be predictive habitat variables. After internal validation via bootstrapping, our model shows an AUC value of 0.91 and a correct classification rate of 87\\%. Considering the methodological difficulties attached to backward selection, we applied Bayesian model averaging as an alternative. This multi-model approach also yielded similar results. To derive simple thresholds for important predictors as a basis for management decisions, we alternatively ran tree-based modelling, which also leads to a very similar selection of predictors. Performance of our different survey approaches was assessed by comparing two independent models with a model including both data resources: one constructed only from field survey data, the other based on data derived from aerial photographs. Models based on field data seem to perform slightly better than those based on aerial photography, but models using both predictor datasets provided the highest predictive accuracy.",

As an example of insect disturbance we studied effects of gaps generated by outbreaks of the spruce bark beetle (Ips typographus) on biodiversity in the area of the National Park ``Bavarian Forest'' and compared them with openings (e.g. meadows) created by humans in these forests. Insects were sampled using flight interception traps across twelve ecotones between edges of closed forest, six bark beetle gaps and six meadows. The diversity and species density of true bugs and of bees/wasps increased significantly from the closed stand to the edge, and continued to increase inside the openings at interior and exterior edges. Species density in saproxylic beetles also increased significantly from closed forest to opening, but only across ecotones including bark beetle gaps. Similarly, the number of critically endangered saproxylic beetles increased significantly in bark beetle gaps. Using indicator species analysis a total of 60 species were identified as possessing a statistically significant value indicating preference for one of the habitat types along the ecotones: 29 of them preferred gaps, 24 preferred meadows, three were characteristic for edges of meadows, three for edges of bark beetle gaps, but only one was typical of closed forest. Most of our results support the thesis that I. typographus fulfils the majority of criteria for a keystone species, particularly that of maintenance of biodiversity in forests. Our results emphasize the value for the study and conservation of insect diversity of the policy of non-interference with natural processes pursued in some protected areas. As a recommendation to forest management for increasing insect diversity even in commercial forest, we suggest that logging in recent gaps in medium aged mixed montane stands should aim at retention of a part of the dead wood. Planting should be avoided, to lengthen the important phase of sunlit conditions.",

    "volume": "12","number": "2","pages": "107","abstract": "Compared to agricultural land and spruce plantations, central European beech-oak forests are often relatively close to natural conditions. However, forest management may alter these conditions. In Steigerwald, southern Germany, a large beech-dominated forest area, three management intensities were applied during the past 30--70 years. Here, we examined the influence of management intensity on saproxylic beetles in >100-year old mature stands at 69 sampling plots in 2004. We sampled beetles using flight-window traps and time standard direct searches. The community structure based on presence/absence data changed remarkably along the gradient from unmanaged to low-intensity to high-intensity management, but these differences were not evident using abundance data from flight interception traps. Saproxylic species richness decreased in intensively managed forests. Elateridae and threatened species richness peaked in unmanaged forests and in forests under low-intensity management. Saproxylic species richness was dependent on certain micro-habitat factors. These factors were (1) the amount of dead wood for Elateridae, overall and threatened saproxylic beetle richness; (2) the amount of flowering plants for Cerambycidae; (3) the richness of wood-inhabiting fungi for Staphylinidae, Melandryidae and overall saproxylic beetle richness; and (4) the frequency of Fomes fomentarius for threatened species. Species richness was better explained by plot factors, such as dead wood or fungi, than by management intensity. These results suggest that the natural variation of dead wood niches (decay stages, snag sizes, tree cavities and wood-inhabiting fungi species) must be maintained to efficiently conserve the whole saproxylic beetle fauna of beech forests. Also, intensive management may alter the specialised saproxylic beetle community even if the initial tree-species composition is maintained, which was the case in our study. For monitoring the ecological sustainability of forest management we must focus on threatened species. If structures alone are sampled then the amount of dead wood is the best indicator for a rich saproxylic beetle fauna.",

Such knowledge is frequently gathered from studies relating abundance data to a set of influential variables in a regression setup. In particular, generalised linear models are used to analyse binary presence/absence data or counts of a certain species at locations within an observation area. However, one of the key assumptions of generalised linear models, the independence of observations is often violated in practice since the points at which the observations are collected are spatially aligned. In this paper, we describe a general framework for semiparametric spatial generalised linear models that allows for the routine analysis of non-normal spatially aligned regression data. The approach is utilised for the analysis of a data set of synthetic bird species in beech forests, revealing that ignorance of spatial dependence actually may lead to false conclusions in a number of situations.",

    "volume": "126","number": "4","pages": "513-527","abstract": "Current silvicultural treatments in beech forests are aimed at achieving thick logs without discoloured hardwood. Therefore intensive thinning is applied already in younger stands with the objective of large-sized trunks at an age of 100 years. However, this approach bears the risk that dead wood structures and broken trees are completely removed from the forest. The impact of three different silvicultural management intensity levels on wood-inhabiting fungi over decades was investigated in a large beech forest (>10,000 ha) in southern Germany in 69 sampling plots: A Intensive Thinning and Logging with high-value trees, B Conservation-Oriented Logging with integration of special structures such as dead wood and broken trees and C Strict Forest Reserves with no logging for 30 years. The analysis of community showed marked differences in the fungus species composition of the three treatments, independent of stand age. The relative frequencies of species between treatments were statistically different. Indicator species for naturalness were more abundant at sites with low silvicultural management intensity. Fomes fomentarius, the most common fungus in virgin forests and strict forest reserves, is almost missing in forests with high-management intensity. The species richness seemed to be lower where intensive thinning was applied (P = 0.051). Species characteristic for coarse woody debris were associated to low management intensity, whereas species with a significant preference for stumps became more frequent with increasing management intensity. A total amount of dead wood higher than 60 m3/ha was found to enable significantly higher numbers of species indicators of naturalness (P = 0.013). In conclusion, when applying intensive silvicultural treatment, the role of dead wood needs to be actively considered in order to maintain the natural biocoenosis of beech forests.",

The objectives were to study the effects of habitat characteristics on snail density and species richness. Habitat structures were determined for 37 plots in one big forest. We found a significant relationship between the number of snail species and individuals and the following set of habitat factors coverage of herbaceous layer, growing stock, mean diameter at breast height of the three largest trees (DBHmax), stand age, total dead wood volume per ha, and advanced decomposed dead wood volume per ha. We use maximally selected rank statistics to estimate cutpoints separating stands with low densities, from stands with high snail densities. Here, we define cutpoints for a significant higher snail density at a stand age of 187 years, 57 m3/ha dead wood, 40 m3/ha advanced decomposed dead wood, 63 cm DBHmax and more than 1\\% herbaceous layer. For species richness, cutpoints are estimated at 338 m3/ha stand volume, 170 years stand age, 50 m3/ha total dead wood amount, 15 m3/ha advanced decomposed dead wood and 56 cm DBHmax. The microhabitat analysis shows a higher pH value and a higher Calcium content at the bottom of large snags and under large lying dead wood pieces in comparison to litter, upper mineral soil and at the bottom of vital living trees. Snail species and individual density are significantly linked to these patterns of chemical parameters. The identified cutpoints are a good base for ecological management decisions in forest management.",

A measure commonly used for the assessment of logging is the occurrence and density of character species typical for the local biotope. Near-natural forest structures can be designed only when sufficient knowledge about the relationship between species and habitat factors is available. We suggest the use of simple cutpoint regression models for the derivation of statistically valid rules of thumb. The methodology is applied to bird and structure data of ancient and present oak coppices with standards to demonstrate its practical application. The cutpoints are derived from estimates of break points by means of maximally selected two-sample statistics, and their validity is judged by multiple test procedures. Detailed results are presented for character species and their relationships to the environment. We show that, for example, the tree pipit (Anthus trivialis) is missing in stands with more than 40\\% canopy overstorey, whereas this species can be regularly observed in more open stands. For the tree pipit, the analysis is illustrated by means of a free software package.",

    "volume": "9","number": "7","pages": "1-8","abstract": "Windstorms, bark beetle outbreaks and fires are important natural disturbances in coniferous forests worldwide. Wind-thrown trees promote biodiversity and restoration within production forests, but also cause large economic losses due to bark beetle infestation and accelerated fungal decomposition. Such damaged trees are often removed by salvage logging, which leads to decreased biodiversity and thus increasingly evokes discussions between economists and ecologists about appropriate strategies. To reveal the reasons behind species loss after salvage logging, we used a functional approach based on four habitat-related ecological traits and focused on saproxylic beetles. We predicted that salvage logging would decrease functional diversity (measured as effect sizes of mean pairwise distances using null models) as well as mean values of beetle body size, wood diameter niche and canopy cover niche, but would increase decay stage niche. As expected, salvage logging caused a decrease in species richness, but led to an increase in functional diversity by altering the species composition from habitat-filtered assemblages toward random assemblages. Even though salvage logging removes tree trunks, the most negative effects were found for small and heliophilous species and for species specialized on wood of small diameter. Our results suggested that salvage logging disrupts the natural assembly process on windthrown trees and that negative ecological impacts are caused more by microclimate alteration of the dead-wood objects than by loss of resource amount. These insights underline the power of functional approaches to detect ecosystem responses to anthropogenic disturbance and form a basis for management decisions in conservation. To mitigate negative effects on saproxylic beetle diversity after windthrows, we recommend preserving single windthrown trees or at least their tops with exposed branches during salvage logging. Such an extension of the green-tree retention approach to windthrown trees will preserve natural succession and associated communities of disturbed spruce forests.",

    "volume": "16","number": "2","pages": "267-276","abstract": "Habitat fragmentation is one of the main threats to biodiversity. Reintroductions or translocations may mitigate its effects by allowing species with limited dispersal ability to exploit otherwise inaccessible habitat patches. Despite the fact that reintroductions are among the most effective conservation measures, they are rarely used for invertebrates. In this study we investigate the potential of reintroductions as a conservation measure for beetles, and present the first genetic results for an endangered veteran tree specialist. After translocation of 10 adults in 1987, a population of the Great Capricorn beetle reappeared in Hluboká nad Vltavou (Czech Republic) in 1990s. Using population genetic analyses of 79 individuals based on nine microsatellite loci and 82 individuals based on the mitochondrial COI gene we assessed the origin of this population, and compared its genetic variation, population structure and demography to the alleged source population (southern Moravia) and to the closest autochthonous population (Trebonsko). Although the reintroduced and the closest autochthonous populations are geographically close (24 km), their mutual genetic distance was much higher than that between each of them and the geographically distant (>150 km) potential source population in southern Moravia. The genetic diversity of the reintroduced population was the lowest from the three studied populations and represented a subset of the alleged source population suggesting its establishment due to a translocation from southern Moravia. Despite the lower genetic variation at the reintroduced site, our results suggest that reintroductions could serve as a highly effective measure in biodiversity conservation and in some cases it may be the only chance to prevent extirpation of many endangered populations.",

    "volume": "41","number": "2","abstract": "Background: Though the biomass of floral vegetation in understory plant communities in a forested ecosystem only accounts for less than 1% of the total biomass of a forest, they contain most of the floral resources of a forest. The diversity of understory honey plants determines visitation rate of pollinators such as honey bee (Apis mellifera) as they provide rich food resources. Since the flower visitation and foraging activity of pollinators lead to the provision of pollination service, it also means the enhancement of plant-pollinator relationship. Therefore, an appropriate management scheme for understory vegetation is essential in order to conserve pollinator population that is decreasing due to habitat destruction and disease infection. This research examined the diversity of understory honey\r\nplant and studied how it is related to environmental variables such as (1) canopy density, (2) horizontal heterogeneity of canopy surface height, (3) slope gradient, and (4) distance from roads. Vegetation survey data of 39 plots of mixed forests in Chuncheon, Korea, were used, and possible management practices for understory vegetation were suggested.\r\nResults: This study found that 113 species among 141 species of honey plant of the forests were classified as understory vegetation. Also, the understory honey plant diversity is significantly positively correlated with distance from the nearest road and horizontal heterogeneity of canopy surface height and negatively correlated with canopy density.\r\nConclusions: The diversity of understory honey plant vegetation is correlated to vegetation structure and human impact. In order to enhance the diversity of understory honey plant, management of density and height of canopy is necessary. This study suggests that improved diversity of canopy cover through thinning of overstory vegetation can increase the diversity of understory honey plant species.",

This study compares arthropod predators between productive (organic farming) and non-productive (sown flowering fields) AES along a landscape complexity gradient.\r\n2. We compared species richness, community composition and community weighted mean body sizes of 12 306 carabids and 4868 spiders in organically managed cereal fields and flowering fields along a landscape complexity gradient. These data were used to evaluate the conservation success of different AES types for a number of exclusive species, financial incentives and benefits for farmers.\r\n3. Carabids only responded to the AES type and their communities had higher species richness in flowering fields. Spider species richness increased with landscape complexity. Community composition differed between AES types for all predator groups, with the composition of ground-dwelling spiders being additionally affected by landscape complexity. The mean body size of web-building spiders decreased with landscape complexity and the mean body size of\r\nfemale spiders was larger in flowering fields.\r\n4. Both AES types can contribute to the conservation of predator communities. Species richness increased with non-productive AES. Agrobiont species occurred more frequently in productive AES. The overall number of exclusive predator species was lower in flowering fields.\r\n5. We emphasise that there is an additive effect of establishing productive and non-productive AES within the landscape, and a diverse mosaic of different AES types holds the greatest potential to provide a large regional species pool of arthropod predators, while simultaneously guaranteeing financial benefits for farmers from production and subsidies.",

Despite potential negative effects on\r\nbiodiversity, salvage logging is often conducted, even in areas otherwise excluded\r\nfrom logging and reserved for nature conservation, inter alia because strategic priorities for post-­disturbance management are widely lacking.\r\n2.\t A review of the existing literature revealed that most studies investigating the effects of salvage logging on biodiversity have been conducted less than 5 years following natural disturbances, and focused on non-­saproxylic organisms.\r\n3.\t A meta-­analysis across 24 species groups revealed that salvage logging significantly\r\ndecreases numbers of species of eight taxonomic groups. Richness of dead wood\r\ndependent taxa (i.e. saproxylic organisms) decreased more strongly than richness of\r\nnon-­saproxylic taxa. In contrast, taxonomic groups typically associated with open habitats increased in the number of species after salvage logging.\r\n4.\t By analysing 134 original species abundance matrices, we demonstrate that salvage\r\nlogging significantly alters community composition in 7 of 17 species groups, particularly affecting saproxylic assemblages.\r\n5.\t Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that salvage logging is not consistent\r\nwith the management objectives of protected areas. Substantial changes, such as the retention of dead wood in naturally disturbed forests, are needed to support biodiversity. Future research should investigate the amount and spatio-­temporal distribution of retained dead wood needed to maintain all components of biodiversity.",

In former production forests around the Northern Hemisphere, the abandonment of intervention, such as removal of dead wood, after outbreaks of bark beetles has been increasingly promoted to regain more natural conditions. However, many focal species of conservation, such as the barbastelle bat Barbastella barbastellus, do not primarily depend on dead wood but might respond indirectly to disturbance\u2010induced changes of forest structural attributes. We investigated the response of B. barbastellus foraging activity and roost selection by combining acoustic surveys, radio telemetry, and airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) to characterize B. barbastellus habitat use on different scales. B. barbastellus foraging activity increased with increasing canopy opening. Maternity colonies were recorded exclusively in trees killed by bark beetles. Bats preferred roost trees with a higher volume (m3 ha−1) of live trees in the surrounding, and trees with on average larger diameters than nearby control trees. Our results revealed that outbreaks of bark beetles result in forest structural attributes that are suitable habitat for B. barbastellus. Salvage logging, i.e., the removal of beetle\u2010affected trees, generally deteriorates the positive effects of bark\u2010beetle outbreaks on the foraging and roosting habitat of B. barbastellus. We recommend maintaining snags of large diameter if salvage logging is mandatory.",

Key policy directives like the Aichi targets seek to expand protected areas to 17% of Earth\u2019s land surface, with calls by some conservation biologists for much more. However, in places such as the United States, Germany, and Australia, attempts to increase protected areas are meeting strong resistance from communities, industry groups, and governments. We examined case studies of such resistance in Victoria, Australia, Bavaria, Germany, and Florida, United States. We considered 4 ways to tackle this problem. First, broaden the case for protected areas beyond nature conservation to include economic, human health, and other benefits, and translate these into a persuasive business case for protected areas. Second, better communicate the conservation values of protected areas. This should include highlighting how many species, communities, and ecosystems have been conserved by protected areas and the counterfactual (i.e., what would have been lost without protected area establishment). Third, consider zoning of activities to ensure the maintenance of effective management. Finally, remind citizens to think about conservation when they vote, including holding politicians accountable for their environmental promises. Without tackling resistance to expanding the protected estate, it will be impossible to reach conservation targets, and this will undermine attempts to stem the global extinction crisis.",

    "volume": "8","number": "8","abstract": "Deadwood is an important legacy structure in managed forests, providing continuity in shelter and resource availability for many organisms and acting as a vehicle by which nutrients can be passed from one stand to the next following a harvest. Despite existing at the interface between below- and above-ground systems, however, much remains unknown about the role woody debris plays in linking these zones. More-over, it remains untested whether the accelerative effects of wood-feeding insects on wood decomposition influence tree growth or nutritional status in forests. In this study, we added different quantities of pine logs to the bases of saplings in two-year-old loblolly pine (Pinus taedaL.) plantations in Mississippi, USA. We included a treatment in which subterranean termites (Blattodea: Rhinotermitidae:Reticulitermes)were excluded from logs to determine how these insects affect the release of nutrients from wood and, in turn, tree growth. After 51 months of decomposition, we quantified below-ground effects by measuring microbial biomass, plant-available forms of N, and ectomycorrhizal diversity associated with fine tree roots. Mean-while, above-ground measurements focused on the elemental concentrations in decomposing wood either protected or unprotected from termites and tree metrics related to growth and nutrient status. We found additions of wood to significantly increase nitrate and potential net nitrification relative to reference treatments but detected no significant effects on tree growth, needle nitrogen concentrations, or ectomycorrhizal diversity. Soil nitrate and potential net nitrification were higher under protected vs. unprotected logs, and plant-available forms of N were mostly more abundant short distances away from both protected and unprotected logs than directly under them. The wood of logs protected from termites had significantly lower concentrations of most elements compared to that of unprotected logs, largely due to the large amounts of soil imported into unprotected logs by termites. Termite exclusion had no measurable effect on tree growth, nutritional status, or ectomycorrhizal diversity, however. Our findings indicate that deadwood and termites both contribute to the spatial heterogeneity of soil properties but may have limited short-term local effects on tree growth. Longer-term studies and studies on less fertile sites are needed.",

    "volume": "27","number": "4","pages": "407-416","abstract": "Aim: The observed decrease in insect colour lightness with increasing latitude has been explained in earlier macroecological studies by the increased solar absorption of dark coloration, which allows extended periods of activity. However, melanin-based dark coloration also protects against pathogens and ultraviolet radiation, which select for dark coloration at low latitudes where these\r\nselection pressures intensify. In nocturnal insects, the relative importance of these protective functions of dark coloration is expected to surpass thermoregulatory functions, as nocturnal species cannot benefit from extended periods of activity during the daytime. Hence, we expected that diurnal and nocturnal insects show contrasting geographical patterns of colour lightness. We tested these predictions using geometrid moths, which comprise both diurnal and nocturnal species.\r\nLocation: Western Palearctic.\r\nTime period: Contemporary.\r\nMajor taxa studied: Geometridae (Lepidoptera).\r\nMethods: We used digital image analysis to assess the colour lightness of 637 species, compiled their distribution across 3,777 grid cells of 50 km 3 50 km and calculated the assemblage-based\r\naverage colour lightness. We used multiple regressions, autoregressive error models and randomizations to test for relationships between colour lightness and environmental variables associated with the thermal environment, putative pathogen pressure and ultraviolet radiation.\r\nResults: We found a clear decrease in colour lightness of assemblages of both diurnal and nocturnal moth species with increasing latitude. In every model, solar radiation was the most important predictor of colour lightness; that is, colour lightness consistently increased with increasing solar radiation.\r\nMain conclusions: These results indicate that the thermal environment is the most influential climatic driver of insect colour lightness\u2014independent of thermoregulatory strategy and nocturnal or diurnal activity. This challenges the view that extended periods of activity are the main selection pressure for geographical variation in insect colour lightness. Consequently, the relationship between insect colour lightness and the thermal environment might be more general than previously thought.",

Previous studies suggested that wood-inhabiting fungal communities are affected by climate, availability of dead wood in the surrounding landscape and characteristics of the colonized dead-wood object (e.g. host tree\r\nspecies). These findings indicate that different filters structure fungal communities at different scales, but how these factors individually drive fungal fruiting diversity on dead-wood objects is unknown.\r\n2.\t We conducted an orthogonal experiment comprising 180 plots (0.1 ha) in a random block design and measured fungal fruit body richness and community composition on 720 dead-wood objects over the first 4 years of succession. The experiment allowed us to disentangle the effects of the host (beech and fir; logs and branches) and the environment (microclimate: sunny and shady plots; local\r\ndead wood: amount and heterogeneity of dead wood added to plot).\r\n3.\t Variance partitioning revealed that the host was more important than the environment for the diversity of wood-inhabiting fungi. A more detailed model revealed that host tree species had the highest independent effect on richness and community composition of fruiting species of fungi. Host size had significant but low independent effects on richness and community composition of fruiting species. Canopy openness significantly affected the community composition of fruiting species. By contrast, neither local amount nor heterogeneity of dead wood significantly affected the fungal diversity measures.\r\n4.\t Synthesis. Our study identified host tree species as a more important driver of the diversity of wood-inhabiting fungi than the environment, which suggests a host-centred filter of this diversity in the early phase of the decomposition process. For the conservation of wood-inhabiting fungi, a high variety of host species in various\r\nmicroclimates is more important than the availability of dead wood at the stand level.",

    "volume": "32","number": "3","pages": "535-545","abstract": "Limited knowledge of dispersal for most organisms hampers effective connectivity conservation in fragmented landscapes. In forest ecosystems, deadwood-dependent organisms (i.e., saproxylics) are negatively affected by forest management and degradation globally. We reviewed empirically established dispersal ecology of saproxylic insects and fungi. We focused on direct studies (e.g., mark-recapture, radiotelemetry), field experiments, and population genetic analyses. We found 2 somewhat opposite results. Based on direct methods and experiments, dispersal is limited to within a few kilometers, whereas genetic studies showed little genetic structure over tens of kilometers, which indicates long-distance dispersal. The extent of direct dispersal studies and field experiments was small and thus these studies could not have detected long-distance dispersal. Particularly for fungi, more studies at management-relevant scales (1-10 km) are needed. Genetic researchers used outdated markers, investigated few loci, and faced the inherent difficulties of inferring dispersal from genetic population structure. Although there were systematic and species-specific differences in dispersal ability (fungi are better dispersers than insects), it seems that for both groups colonization and establishment, not dispersal per se, are limiting their occurrence at management-relevant scales. Because most studies were on forest landscapes in Europe, particularly the boreal region, more data are needed from nonforested landscapes in which fragmentation effects are likely to be more pronounced. Given the potential for long-distance dispersal and the logical necessity of habitat area being a more fundamental landscape attribute than the spatial arrangement of habitat patches (i.e., connectivity sensu strict), retaining high-quality deadwood habitat is more important for saproxylic insects and fungi than explicit connectivity conservation in many cases.",

We review the extent of, and motivations for, post-disturbance logging in protected and unprotected forests globally. An unprecedented level of logging in protected areas and other places where green-tree harvest would not normally occur is driven by economic interests and a desire for pest control. To avoid failure of global initiatives dedicated to reducing the loss of species, five key policy reforms are necessary: (1) salvage logging must be banned from protected areas; (2) forest planning should address altered disturbance regimes for all intact forests to ensure that significant areas remain undisturbed by logging; (3) new kinds of integrated analyses are needed to assess the potential economic benefits of salvage logging against its ecological, economic, and social costs; (4) global and regional maps of natural disturbance regimes should be created to guide better spatio-temporal planning of protected areas and undisturbed forests outside reserves; and\r\n(5) improved education and communication programs are needed to correct widely-held misconceptions about natural disturbances.",

The importance of certain habitat features for structuring species composition, however, may be determined by the availability of resources that can seasonally fluctuate. The Kenyan Arabuko Sokoke coastal forest consists of three pristine forest types and provides various anthropogenic forest-like habitats, such as plantations and transition zones between forest and agricultural land. In parallel, this region experiences pronounced climatic seasonality which causes differences in resource availability. To test for potential differences in butterfly communities between natural and anthropogenic forest habitats, and whether they vary seasonally, we assessed butterfly species along transects in all five habitat types during the rainy and the consecutive dry season. We compiled ecological characteristics for each transect and for each butterfly species. We found highest species richness and abundances in the three natural forest habitats during the rainy season. Our data show distinct species clusters for each habitat type during the rainy season. In contrast, butterfly species composition does not form distinct community groups during the dry season. During this time period, highest species richness and abundances are found in plantations. These temporal differences in species richness, abundance and species composition between the two seasons are assumed to be driven by limited nectar availability inside of the forest during the dry season. This situation might lead to increased mobility and the invasion of anthropogenic habitats, where nectar sources are still available during the dry season. Thus, plantations might represent a surrogate habitat for forest butterflies during their imaginal stage, but do not represent a suitable habitat providing all resources needed for successful larval development.",

One of the most straightforward methods to provide direct measures of animal dispersal is telemetry. Despite its merits, this method has rarely been used for saproxylic beetles. In this study, we examined dispersal ability of the Great Capricorn beetle Cerambyx cerdo (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae), an endangered veteran oak specialist. Using a radio-tracking approach, we tracked 26 individuals (15 males and 11 females) equipped with transmitters for 4 to 17 days (median 14). We observed no disturbance of movements or flight problems due to the transmitter. The daily probability of movement by an individual was 64\\% and the longest displacement in one day was 1498 m for males and 1080 m for females. For 15\\% of all individuals, the tracking distance covered was >2200 m. Our results indicate that C. cerdo individuals often move among trees over an area of several kilometres. Such findings contrast with previous results based on a mark-recapture study. The relatively high mobility of the species should be reflected in strategies aiming at its conservation.",

    "pages": "607--637","abstract": "Natural amounts of dead wood in a forest vary considerably, depending on living tree biomass, decomposition rates, and rates of dead-wood development. In natural forests, dead wood is created by the senescence of trees and natural disturbances. However, dead-wood amounts in many forest ecosystems worldwide nowadays are largely influenced by human activities, such as timber and fuel wood production and post-disturbance salvage logging. The biodiversity of saproxylic insects is usually positively correlated with the amount of dead wood, and dead-wood amount affects species composition and functional characteristics of saproxylic assemblages. Dead-wood amount is in turn correlated with dead-wood diversity, and several studies highlight the importance of dead-wood diversity for saproxylic biodiversity, which suggests that habitat heterogeneity is a major driver behind the positive relationship between dead-wood amount and biodiversity. The strength of this relationship is mediated by temperature. Effects of both temporal forest continuity and spatial connectivity are often linked to differences in dead-wood amount. Frequent interactions and correlations between dead-wood amount and other habitat factors indicate that future studies should aim more precisely at unraveling the importance of individual factors for saproxylic biodiversity, which will help to improve conservation strategies to counteract negative effects of anthropogenically altered dead-wood amount and diversity. Such conservation strategies, particularly in Europe and North America, include passive and active measures to retain dead wood in managed forests and to restore amounts and diversity of dead wood similar to levels in natural forests. More research is needed in the subtropics and tropics where conservation strategies rarely consider dead wood, although the few existing studies suggest that dead wood is an important factor for biodiversity in these regions.",

    "pages": "581-605","abstract": "Primary forestsprimary forests represent the ultimate intact habitat for saproxylic insects. However, their extent has been considerably reduced over the past centuries, and those remaining are very heterogeneously distributed. Primary forestsprimary forests are still locally abundant in tropical and boreal zones but are rare in temperate zones. Consequently, many saproxylic insects that were adapted to typical characteristics of primary forests, such as large amounts of dead wood or overmature and senescent trees, might have become extinct regionally due to habitat loss. The remaining primary forests therefore function as refuges for those saproxylic species that cannot survive in managed forests because of their high ecological requirements. Here we identify six characteristics of primary forests important for saproxylic insects that differentiate these forests greatly from managed forests, namely, absence of habitat fragmentation, continuity, natural disturbance regimes, dead-wood amount and quality, tree species composition and habitat trees. These six characteristics highlight the importance of primary forests for the conservation of saproxylic insects in all three main climatic domains (tropical, boreal and temperate). As primary forests are rare in northern temperate zones and are being dramatically lost in boreal and tropical zones, we propose that they should be strictly conserved independently of their climatic zone. Furthermore, we recommend that studies in primary forests intensify to provide reference data for integrating primary forest characteristics into managed forests to improve the conservation of saproxylic species.",

The southern subspecies of the white-backed woodpecker (Dendrocopos leucotos lilfordi) is among the least studied. We assessed which environmental variables influence the landscape distribution of the southern white-backed woodpecker applying recursive partitioning. We carried out the study in Strandzha Mts., Bulgaria, holding one of the largest subpopulations of this subspecies in south-eastern Europe. The results indicate that the highest occurrence probability is in Oriental Beech (Fagus orientalis) natural stands of seed origin with average age over 140 years. There is relatively high occurrence also in the natural stands of seed origin, dominated by Oak (Quercus spp.) and Hornbeam (Carpinus spp.) and generally with high percent cover of deciduous forests. The species is rarely found in coppice\r\nstands and forest plantations. Based on the results we conclude that the white-backed woodpecker habitat requirements include extensive coverage of deciduous, high-stemmed forest stands that have reached an age that facilitates deadwood formation. We suggest that silvicultural systems such as group selection or irregular shelterwood are implemented to assure continuous forest cover with presence of older patches. We also recommend protection of patches of old-growth, at least 40\u201350 ha in area, covering not less than 10% of the total area of Strandzha.",

These data enable users to calculate temporal trends in biodiversity within and amongst assemblages using a broad range of metrics. BioTIME is being developed as a community-led open-source database of biodiversity time series. Our goal is to accelerate and facilitate quantitative analysis of temporal patterns of biodiversity in the Anthropocene.\r\nMain types of variables included: The database contains 8,777,413 species abundance records, from assemblages consistently sampled for a minimum of 2 years, which need not necessarily be consecutive. In addition, the database contains metadata relating to sampling methodology and contextual information about each record.\r\nSpatial location and grain: BioTIME is a global database of 547,161 unique sampling locations spanning the marine, freshwater and terrestrial realms. Grain size varies across datasets from 0.0000000158 km 2 (158 cm 2 ) to 100 km 2 (1,000,000,000,000 cm 2 ).\r\nTime period and grain: BioTIME records span from 1874 to 2016. The minimal temporal grain across all datasets in BioTIME is a year.\r\nMajor taxa and level of measurement: BioTIME includes data from 44,440 species across the plant and animal kingdoms, ranging from plants, plankton and terrestrial invertebrates to small and large vertebrates.",

    "volume": "10","number": "1-2","abstract": "By manipulating faeces during feeding and breeding, dung beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) fulfil important ecosystem functions in terrestrial ecosystems throughout the world. In a pan-European multi\u2010site experiment (MSE), we estimated the ecosystem functions of dung removal and secondary seed dispersal by differing combinations of dung beetle functional groups. Therefore, we classified dung beetles into five functional groups according to their body size and dung manipulation method: dwellers, large and small tunnelers, and large and small rollers.\r\nFurthermore, we set up a dung beetle sampling database containing all sampled dung beetles during the project. By identifying dung beetle specimens to the species level, we obtained a detailed insight into the dung beetle communities at each study location.\r\nBy establishing experimental plots allowing and inhibiting specific combinations of functional groups in the local dung beetle assemblage from removing dung and seeds, we estimated the role of each group in dung removal and secondary seed dispersal during a 4-week period.\r\nWe performed all experiments in grazed (semi-)natural grasslands, and used different dung types (cattle, horse, sheep, goat or red deer) to match the herbivore species grazing in close vicinity of each of the study areas. Simultaneously, we sampled dung beetle assemblages by using pitfalls baited with the same dung types as used in the experiments.\r\nThis data paper documents two datasets collected in the framework of this MSE project. All the experiments took place between 2013 and 2016 at 17 study sites in 10 countries and 11 biogeographic zones. The entire dung beetle sampling dataset was published as a sampling\r\nevent dataset at GBIF. The dataset includes the sampling results of all 17 study sites, which contain 1,050 sampling events and 4,362 occurrence records of 94 species. The second dataset contains the results of the dung removal and secondary seed dispersal experiments in which we used 11 experimental treatments and the five dung types mentioned above. This experimental results dataset holds all experimental results of the MSE project (11,537 records), and was published in the online data repository Zenodo.",

    "volume": "45","number": "12","abstract": "Aim: The Rosalia longicorn (Rosalia alpina) is an internationally protected icon of\r\nbiodiversity associated with old trees and dead wood. Although the beetle regularly exploits several marginal hosts, its preferred main host is European beech (Fagus sylvatica s.l.). Moreover, the geographical ranges of R. alpina and beech closely overlap. To assess whether their spatial association is mirrored in the genetic patterns of both species, we investigated the phylogeography of Rosalia alpina over its entire geographical range and compared it with the known genetic patterns of its hosts.\r\nLocation: Europe and western Asia.\r\nMethods: Using both mitochondrial (COI) and nuclear (14 microsatellite loci) markers, we analysed 148 (444, respectively) individuals from 31 (30, respectively) sites. We constructed a Bayesian Inference tree and a haplotype network, calculated the spatial analysis of molecular variance and assessed the population structure of our dataset using two Bayesian clustering methods (STRUCTURE and BAPS).\r\nResults: Mitochondrial markers suggested existence of five clades in R. alpina popu-\r\nlations. Two of them were endemic to the Italian mainland, one to Sicily, and another to southern Turkey. The remaining clade probably originated in the Balkans and colonized the rest of the species\u2019 range. Nuclear markers supported this division. They also suggested two main recolonization routes from the Balkans; one heading north and then both west and east, the second expanding eastwards as far as the Caucasus. The observed genetic patterns were largely congruent with those of European beech.\r\nMain conclusions: The results of both markers were mostly congruent, suggesting at least four potential refugia for R. alpina located in the southernmost parts of its geographical range. Its populations from a large part of Europe and western Asia,\r\nhowever, were genetically poor, dominated by a single haplotype. Phylogeographies\r\nof the beetle and its main host seem to be tightly matched, reflecting their common\r\nhistory.",

    "volume": "46","number": "1","abstract": "Aim: In several ecosystems, the diversity of functional species traits has been shown to have a stronger effect on ecosystem functioning than taxonomic diversity alone. However, few studies have explored this idea at a large geographical scale. In a multisite experiment, we unravelled the relationship between ecosystem function and functional completeness of species assemblages using dung beetles as a model group, focusing on dung removal and secondary seed dispersal.\r\nLocation: Seventeen grassland locations across the Western Palaearctic.\r\nMethods: We used a randomized block design with different exclosure types to control the dung and seed removing activities of individual functional groups of the local dung beetle assemblage. We classified dung beetle species according to resource specialization and into functional groups based on dung processing behaviour (dwellers, tunnellers, rollers) and body size (small, large). Additionally, we assessed the role of other soil macro\u2010invertebrates. By sampling the dung beetle community and measuring the remaining dung and seeds after the experiment, the impact of each functional group was estimated.\r\nResults: Dung beetle assemblages differed along a north\u2013south and east\u2013west gradient. Dwellers dominated northernmost sites, whereas at lower latitudes we observed more tunnellers and rollers indicating a functional shift. Resource specialists were more abundant in southern and eastern areas. Overall, functional group diversity enhanced dung removal. More dung (+46.9%) and seeds (+32.1%) were removed in the southern sites and tunnellers and rollers were more effective. At the northernmost sites, where tunnellers were scarce or absent, other soil macro\u2010invertebrates removed the majority of dung.\r\nMain conclusions: The conservation of functionally complete dung beetle assemblages is crucial to maintain the ecosystem functions provided by dung beetles. Given the latitudinal variation in functional group diversity, it is reasonable to expect compositional changes due to climate change. These changes could lead to increased dung removal and a higher secondary seed dispersal rate in northern regions.",

Nowadays, some of these forests are being restored by enrichment with dead wood, but mostly only at stand scales. Here, we investigated effects of a seminal dead\u2010wood enrichment strategy on saproxylic organisms at the landscape scale.\r\nLocation: Temperate European beech forest in southern Germany.\r\nMethods: In a before\u2013after control\u2013impact design, we compared assemblages and gamma diversities of saproxylic organisms in strictly protected old\u2010growth forest areas (reserves) and historically moderately and intensively managed forest areas before and a decade after starting a landscape\u2010wide strategy of dead\u2010wood\r\nenrichment.\r\nResults: Before enrichment with dead wood, the gamma diversity of saproxylic organisms in historically intensively managed forest stands was significantly lower than in reserves and historically moderately managed forest stands; this difference disappeared after 10 years of dead\u2010wood enrichment. The species composition of beetles\r\nin forest stands of the three historical management intensities differed before the enrichment strategy, but a decade thereafter, the species compositions of previously intensively logged and forest reserve plots were similar. However, the differences in fungal species composition between historical management categories before and\r\nafter 10 years of enrichment persisted.\r\nMain conclusions: Our results demonstrate that intentional enrichment of dead wood at the landscape scale is a powerful tool for rapidly restoring saproxylic beetle communities and for restoring wood\u2010inhabiting fungal communities, which need longer than a decade for complete restoration. We propose that a strategy of area\u2010\r\nwide active restoration combined with some permanent strict refuges is a promising means of promoting the biodiversity of age\u2010long intensively managed Central European beech forests.",

    "volume": "232","pages": "138-144","abstract": "Extensive outbreaks of bark beetles have affected not only large parts of coniferous forests in the Northern Hemisphere, but also - largely absent from global attention - native pine forests of Central America. As such outbreaks frequently spark management debates among residents, land managers, forest owners and the public, the social acceptance of bark beetle control measures has become crucial for modern land management. However, the sociological and psychological determinants of the preference for specific bark beetle control measures outside protected areas remain unclear. To determine the acceptability of bark beetle control measures in El Salvador, we assessed how demographic variables, attitude towards the bark beetle, education, and self-reported knowledge affected the preference for different bark beetle control measures in a survey of government employees and local forest owners using a quantitative questionnaire survey. Cumulative link mixed models revealed that the general preference for control measures increased with increasing self-reported knowledge about the bark beetle but decreased with increasing level of respondent education and an increasing positive attitude towards the bark beetle. Respondents generally preferred beetle control measures on small areas than on large areas. Preferences for control measures did not differ between government employees and forest owners, with controlled burning and chemical control significantly less accepted than stand thinning or salvage logging. We discuss the most preferred control measures considering recent scientific evidence of their efficacy and conclude that the current bark beetle outbreak should be controlled through logging of pines weakened by fire in the short-term and by stand thinning in the medium-term to prevent further outbreaks.",

Here we examine the potential of a newly launched satellite-borne radar system (Sentinel-1) to map the bio-\r\ndiversity of twelve taxa across five temperate forest regions in central Europe. We show that the sensitivity of radar to habitat structure is similar to that of airborne laser scanning (ALS), the current gold standard in the measurement of forest structure. Our models of different facets of biodiversity reveal that radar performs as well as ALS; median R2 over twelve taxa by ALS and radar are 0.51 and 0.57 respectively for the first non-metric multidimensional scaling\r\naxes representing assemblage composition. We further demonstrate the promising predictive ability of radar-derived data with external validation based on the species composition of birds and saproxylic beetles. Establishing new area-wide biodiversity monitoring by remote sensing will require the coupling of radar data to stratified and standardized collected local species data.",

The disentangling of potential natural and anthropogenic drivers of nest predation is crucial for the conservation of species. Thus, we investigated the effects of elevation, egg characteristics, vegetation structure and human activities on daily nest predation rates of artificial ground nests by baiting 700 artificial nests with quail eggs along an elevational gradient of about 1100 m. After 25 days, we found an overall daily nest predation rate of 0.045. Our generalized linear mixed model revealed increasing daily predation rates with increasing forest management, no impact of recreational activities, and lower daily predation rates in the vicinity of buildings. Furthermore, daily predation rates declined with increasing density of near-ground vegetation and increased with increasing tree cover. Finally, we found no influence of elevation, matching of egg and ground colouration, and dead wood on daily nest predation rates. Our results revealed that the risk of nest predation depends more on vegetation structure than on current levels of recreational activities. Moreover, the negative relation of nest predation risk and near-ground vegetation indicates that the changing forest structure after natural disturbances (e.g. wind throw or bark beetle infestation), which is tolerated within the benign neglect strategy applied by the authorities of protected areas, decreases the predation risk, whereas salvage logging increases this risk.",

However, studies directly linking variation in the three-dimensional structure of forests to variation in biodiversity are still rare. For canopy arthropods representing a dominant component of forest biodiversity in montane spruce forests of Europe, we used publicly available airborne LiDAR measurements to test the premises of two existing hypotheses that resource concentration and habitat heterogeneity are potential drivers of faunal diversity at both the tree scale and stand scale. We sampled 391 arthropod species from the canopies of 60 trees; coverage-based rarefaction revealed high completeness of faunal sampling (93.7%). When we controlled for elevation and broadleaf tree cover, we found strong (tree and stand scale) context dependence in the response of arthropod diversity to variation in vegetation structure. Arthropod diversity increased with increasing canopy density at the tree scale and was positively associated only with vegetation heterogeneity at the tree scale, but decreased with increasing canopy density at the stand scale. These trends held across all levels of biological response from total richness to diversity measures to richness of different guilds. Our results showed that different components of vegetation structural complexity drive canopy arthropod biodiversity at different spatial scales. Highest canopy arthropod diversity can be expected in spruce forests with relatively open stands containing individual trees with dense and long crowns. Thus, LiDAR opens new avenues for testing ecological hypotheses and for forest-growth models to be linked with the canopy diversity of forests.",

    "volume": "338","pages": "32-45","abstract": "Early-successional forest ecosystems developing after natural disturbances, such as fire, windthrow or insect outbreaks, can support high diversity of habitat structures, species and processes. However, the specific structural and multi-taxon responses that best define a distinct early-seral pre-forest phase, and the longevity of that phase, remain important research questions. To address these questions, we assessed stand structural heterogeneity and species density of various taxa across three biological kingdoms in the initial early-seral period (∼3 years after severe bark beetle outbreak), advanced early-seral period (∼17\u201325 years after severe bark beetle outbreak) and mature spruce forests in unmanaged montane/high-montane ecosystems in Southeastern Germany. We evaluated the hypothesis that changes in structural heterogeneity and increases in diversity would peak in the initial stage and attenuate toward mature forest conditions by 17\u201325 years as the tree canopy closed.\r\n\r\nWe found a clear change in forest structural heterogeneity following the outbreak \u2013 most prominently in reduced cover and more clustered patterning of live trees, increased light availability, increased cover of shrubs and herbs, and high volume of dead wood. Most of these structural changes were not ephemeral after outbreaks, but remained high or even increased after multiple decades, suggesting persistence of early-seral heterogeneity well into succession.\r\n\r\nBiodiversity as measured by species density and rarefaction curves showed variable responses to early-seral conditions depending on taxon and functional group. While some groups either showed no significant change with disturbance (e.g., most epigeics associated with the ground surface), or initially peaked after disturbance before declining quickly (e.g., saproxylic beetles specializing on fresh dead wood), several key groups showed maximum diversity in the advanced early-seral stage (e.g., herbs, herbivores, pollinators) \u2013 indicating that the timeframe over which increases occurred tended to be on the order of decades rather than years.\r\n\r\nOur findings suggest that in unmanaged forests after bark beetle attack, a structurally complex phase prior to tree canopy closure can last several decades, and that many aspects of early-seral biodiversity and ecosystem function only fully develop given this extended time period. Where management of montane forests includes objectives for sustaining biodiversity, accommodating the protracted early-seral stage is important to supporting the full range of organisms and functions associated with canopy-opening disturbances.",

Trap-collected specimens are typically of limited utility for molecular studies due to the poor\r\npreservation of DNA. A stable and cheap substance that can be used to trap arthropods in and preserve their DNA is therefore needed.\r\nHere we test whether (i) 2% SDS, 100mM EDTA, (ii) 1% SDS, 50mM EDTA and (iii) 0.66% SDS, 33mM EDTA can preserve DNA of small and medium-sized beetles for one, four and eight weeks. reservation of DNA was tested using PCR amplification of parts of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I (Cox1) and nuclear 28S rRNA genes. All the solutions tested preserved DNA for at least up to eight weeks and we recommend 2% SDS and 100mM EDTA as a cheap, stable and easily transportable alternative to ethanol for preserving specimens and their DNA collected in the field. This solution is also suitable for using as the collection and preservation liquid in arthropod traps.",

Here, we evaluated the suitability of airborne lidar data in comparison with aerial photographs and field surveys for modelling the distribution of an endangered and cryptic forest species, the hazel grouse (Bonasa bonasia). The study was conducted in the Bavarian Forest National Park of southeast Germany. Subsequently, a prediction map for conservation planning was generated for a large area, which encompassed the National Park. We examined the utility of lidar data for generating a hazel grouse distribution model by using machine learning (boosted regression trees), and then compared the results to variables derived from field surveys and aerial photographs, both separately and in combination. The cross-validated discrimination ability of the model was slightly higher when using lidar data (area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC), 0.79) compared to models using aerial photographs (AUC, 0.75) or field survey data (AUC, 0.78). The predictive performance consistently increased when combining the predictors from different sources, with an AUC of 0.86 being produced in the model combining all three data sources. The three data sources complemented one another, with each data source probably having an advantage at deriving one of three key aspects of the hazel grouse habitat, namely, vertically well-structured forest stands, horizontally mixed successional vegetation stages, and certain deciduous trees as food resources such as mountain ash (Sorbus aucuparia). In addition, the diverse lidar metrics might be applied to simultaneously characterize vertically and horizontally well-structured forest stands. We conclude that public available airborne lidar data are a viable source for creating habitat suitability maps for large areas and may have increased utility for detecting forest characteristics and valuable wildlife habitats.",

Due to their limited dispersal abilities and specific habitat requirements, insects are among the animals most threatened by habitat fragmentation. We studied three populations of the highly endangered species of ground beetle, Carabus hungaricus, at three\r\nsites in Central Europe (Hungary and Czech Republic) using mark-release-recapture (MRR). The total catch of 574 pitfall traps set at\r\nthe three sites was 6255 individuals. Depending on the site, the percentage recaptured was 13\u201332%. Average and maximum distance moved by individuals of both sexes at each of the sites ranged between 47\u2013132 and 207\u20131104 m, respectively. The probability of the movements following an inverse power function (IPF) for the two sexes did not differ, but did differ among sites. Probability of dispersing for distances >100 m differed by an order of magnitude between sites, most likely because of differences in how the samples were collected. Despite the fact that individual beetles are able to move over distances in the order of kilometres, the high fragmentation of their habitats is likely to prevent them from colonizing most uninhabited habitat patches. Therefore, the conservation of this threatened ground beetle could be improved by adopting and implementing a policy of assisted dispersal. Our results from three study sites also provide an interesting illustration of the variability in the estimates of the probability of dispersal obtained using MRR.",

Hence, factors determining the variation in species richness among hosts are a main focus of ecological research. Investigations of determining factors of fungivorous species among host species are still scarce. Based on ecological patterns of parasites and phytophages, we hypothesized that the species richness of tree-fungus beetles of the family Ciidae (Coleoptera) would increase with increasing basidiome size, niche diversity of the growth form, durability, increasing abundance and decreasing phylogenetic isolation of the host fungus. Our generalized least-squares model, controlled by host phylogeny, revealed that Ciidae species richness increases with host  abundance,  but  decreases  with  host  phylogenetic  isolation.  In  contrast  with  our  prediction,  Ciidae  species richness was higher in annual basidiomes than in perennials. Pileate basidiomes revealed higher species richness than resupinate and stipitate basidiomes, which may be interpreted as being a result of their higher host niche diversity. The importance of host abundance, measured on the landscape scale, corroborates that fungivore species richness  among  macrofungal  hosts  is  determined  by  factors  similar  to  those  that  determine  parasite  and phytophage species richness among their hosts.",

We conducted fixed-radius point counts of wintering birds in forest stands logged or unlogged after windthrows and in mature forest stands to test our predictions that bird species densities and abundances (i) are lower in postdisturbance logged stands and (ii) depend on the amount of natural regeneration, (iii) which differs between logged and unlogged stands. Our generalized linear mixed model did not support the expected differences in bird abundance or species densities between postdisturbance logged and unlogged stands but indicated that mature forest stands harbor the highest bird abundances and species densities. The number of regenerated coniferous trees significantly positively affected wintering bird abundances in both postdisturbance logged and unlogged stands. Hence, the number of coniferous trees appears to be a main predictor of wintering bird presence.",

    "volume": "65","pages": "142-148","abstract": "Natural disturbances, such as fire, windstorms and insect outbreaks, are important drivers of biodiversity in forest ecosystems, but at the same time cause large economic losses. Among the natural disturbances in Europe, windstorms cause the highest economic loss. After such storms, damaged forest stands are commonly salvage logged to restore economic value. However, such interventions could affect species assemblages of various taxonomic groups, including breeding birds. Despite these potential effects, investigations of the impacts of post-storm logging are largely lacking. We thus investigated assemblages of breeding birds in 21 logged and 21 unlogged windstorm-disturbed forest plots and 18 undisturbed, control forest plots using fixed-radius point-stop counts three, five and seven years after a windstorm within the Bavarian Forest National Park as part of the European Long-Term Ecosystem Research Network. We recorded 2100 bird individuals of 55 bird species. Bird assemblages were predominantly altered by the consequences of the windstorm and affected only to a minor degree by subsequent logging of storm-felled trees. Nevertheless, bird species richness was significantly reduced by post-storm logging within the first season. In general, the windstorm led to a shift in bird assemblage composition from typical forest species towards open- and shrub-land species. Assemblages of logged and unlogged disturbed plots consisted mainly of long-distance migrants and ground-foraging bird species, whereas assemblages of undisturbed control plots consisted of resident species that forage within vegetation. Both unlogged and logged storm-felled coniferous forest stands were inhabited by endangered or declining bird species, such as Water Pipit (Anthus spinoletta) on logged plots and Eurasian Redstart (Phoenicurus phoenicurus) on unlogged plots. Indicator species analyses suggested that species of unlogged storm disturbed plots depended on storm-created legacies, such as pits and snags, for foraging and nesting. Hence, we recommend reducing post-storm logging of these legacies to support species restricted to unlogged disturbed forest. To increase the diversity of breeding birds on the landscape scale, diverse logged and unlogged post-disturbance stands should be provided, which could be gained by a partial benign neglect strategy of storm disturbed forest stands.",

    "volume": "65","pages": "149-160","abstract": "Conifer-dominated forests in the northern hemisphere are prone to large-scale natural disturbances, yet our understanding of their effects beyond changes in species diversity is limited. Bark beetle disturbances provide dead wood for lignicolous fungal guilds and increase insolation but also desiccation. We investigated whether species richness of these guilds increases and functional diversity decreases after bark beetle disturbance, which would promote through habitat filtering the coexistence of species adapted to harsh conditions, i.e. light stress for lichens and substrate desiccation for wood-inhabiting fungi. We sampled epixylic and epiphytic lichens (primary producers) and wood-inhabiting fungi (mainly wood decomposers, some form ectomycorrhizas) in the Bohemian Forest (Long Term Ecological Research\u2013 LTER \u2013 Site Bavarian Forest National Park), an area in Central Europe most heavily affected by the bark beetle Ips typographus, on undisturbed plots and disturbed plots with spruce (Picea abies) dieback 8 years ago. We analysed species diversity, functional diversity (optimized by phylogeny), and functional compositions. Species richness of lichens but not that of wood-inhabiting fungi was higher on disturbed plots than on undisturbed plots. Community compositions of both guilds differed considerably on disturbed and undisturbed plots. On both types of plots, lichen communities were clustered according to functional diversity, which indicated habitat filtering, and fungal communities were overdispersed, which indicated competition. Disturbance increased the strength of these two patterns only slightly and was significant only for fungi. Single-trait analysis revealed changes in the functional composition; on disturbed plots, lichenous species with larger and more complex growth forms and fungi with large, perennial fruit bodies were favoured. Although the forest canopy changed tremendously because of the bark beetle disturbance, the most important driver of lichen and fungal diversity and mean trait assemblages seemed to be the enrichment of dead wood. The changes in insolation and moisture did not act as habitat filters for either guild. This indicated that the assembly patterns of lichen and fungal communities in coniferous forests are not affected by stand-replacing disturbances in contrast to the predictions for other disturbance regimes.",

Most strategies combine knowledge from observational and experimental studies but remain preliminary as many facets of the complex relationships are unstudied. In this first global review of 79 experimental studies addressing biodiversity patterns in dead wood, we identify major knowledge gaps and aim to foster collaboration among researchers by providing a map of previous and ongoing experiments. We show that research has focused primarily on temperate and boreal forests, where results have helped in developing evidence-based conservation strategies, whereas comparatively few such efforts have been made in subtropical or tropical zones. Most studies have been limited to early stages of wood decomposition and many diverse and functionally important saproxylic taxa, e.g., fungi, flies and termites, remain under-represented. Our meta-analysis confirms the benefits of dead-wood addition for biodiversity, particularly for saproxylic taxa, but shows that responses of non-saproxylic taxa are heterogeneous. Our analysis indicates that global conservation of organisms associated with dead wood would benefit most by prioritizing research in the tropics and other neglected regions, focusing on advanced stages of wood decomposition and assessing a wider range of taxa. By using existing experimental set-ups to study advanced decay stages and additional taxa, results could be obtained more quickly and with less effort compared to initiating new experiments.",

    "volume": "359","pages": "51-58","abstract": "In fire-susceptible boreal forests, clear-cutting has been justified as being a harvesting regime that mimics natural stand-replacing dynamics, despite obvious differences in its biological legacies. Prescribed burning and retention forestry are commonly applied to better maintain naturally occurring legacies, but the community-level effects of different disturbances on the functional characteristics of biota remains still largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the effects of prescribed fire, clear-cutting and retention forestry on the functional properties of saproxylic beetle assemblages in Eastern Finland, using stand-level data from a before-after field experiment with four levels of tree retention (0, 10 and 50 m3 ha−1 and control) and prescribed burning. We analyzed the functional-phylogenetic diversity and a set of species traits that link species to resources. The data include 377 beetle species and 38 549 individuals. Functional-phylogenetic diversity decreased from a random to a clustered pattern after burning and logging with retention trees, indicating environmental filtering of both processes. These effects became more pronounced with increasing logging intensity. Species-level traits that were favored by burning and tree retention were connected to open-habitat conditions and fresh dead wood, whereas clear-cutting revealed a random pattern without reference to specific resources. Our functional approach thus shows that clear-cutting does not mimic the dynamics of wildfire, but leads to different functional composition of species assemblages. Therefore, prescribed burning or wildfire should be incorporated and sufficient amount of trees retained in forest management to conserve functional processes and natural composition of saproxylic species assemblages in boreal forests.",

By contrast, the co-existence of scientific and alternative conceptions may indicate a fragmented knowledge profile. Every learner is unique and thus carries an individual set of preconceptions before classroom engagement due to prior experiences. Hence, instructors and teachers have to consider the heterogeneous knowledge profiles of their class when teaching. However, determinants of fragmented knowledge profiles are not well understood yet, which may hamper a development of adapted teaching schemes. We used a questionnaire-based approach to assess conceptual knowledge of tree assimilation and wood synthesis surveying 885 students of four educational levels: 6th graders, 10th graders, natural science freshmen and other academic studies freshmen. We analysed the influence of learner\u2019s characteristics such as educational level, age and sex on the coexistence of scientific and alternative conceptions. Within all subsamples well-known alternative conceptions regarding tree assimilation and wood synthesis coexisted with correct scientific ones. For example, students describe trees to be living on \u201Csoil and sunshine\u201D, representing scientific knowledge of photosynthesis mingled with an alternative conception of trees eating like animals. Fragmented knowledge profiles occurred in all subsamples, but our models showed that improved education and age foster knowledge integration. Sex had almost no influence on the existing scientific conceptions and evolution of knowledge integration. Consequently, complex biological issues such as tree assimilation and wood synthesis need specific support e.g. through repeated learning units in class- and seminar-rooms in order to help especially young students to handle and overcome common alternative conceptions and appropriately integrate scientific conceptions into their knowledge profile.",

Local management and landscape composition influence spider and prey communities and thereby their trophic interactions and functional role in arthropod food webs. We compared predator-prey interactions between organically managed cereal fields and sown flower-rich fields, both supported by agri-environmental schemes. The surrounding landscape of twelve study sites differed in the percentage of arable crops within a radius of 500 m around each site. We analyzed 1036 hand-collected web-building spiders with 5270 prey items from webs and 6777 potentially available prey items sampled by fenced suction sampling. Thysanoptera significantly dominated prey composition of web-building spiders in cereal fields located in landscapes with low percentages of arable crops, while Nematocera dominated prey composition in sown flower-rich fields. The captured prey numbers per spider web, irrespective of taxonomic identity, increased with the availability of potential prey, independent of habitat type or landscape composition. We did not find any effect on the compositions of web-building spiders and potential prey. Our results suggest that spider webs act as traps for prey that depend on prey density. However, this simple interpretation is only valid for the overall prey quantity, while capture success of single prey taxa may be habitat-specific and depend on landscape features. The impact of land use at different spatial scales on the functional role of web-building spiders should caution us towards density-based estimates of predation processes, e.g. when assessing the impact of agri-environmental schemes on arthropod food webs.",

Hence, mechanical bark treatments, such as debarking, of disturbance-affected trees have been widely promoted as an on-site method of pest control that accounts for conservation targets because woody biomass is retained. However, the effects of debarking to non-target biodiversity remain unclear. We analyzed data from a two-and-a-half-year field survey of wood-inhabiting fungi, saproxylic beetles and parasitoid wasps in twelve artificial windthrows, created by pulling down mature Norway spruce trees (Picea abies) with winches. Each experimental windthrow comprising one control tree, one completely debarked tree and one bark-scratched tree. Insects were sampled using stem emergence traps. Fruiting bodies of wood-inhabiting fungi, number of wood wasp emergence holes, and number of holes made by foraging woodpeckers were assessed by visual counts. We recorded the amount of time needed to complete debarking by machine, bark-scratching by machine and bark-scratching by chainsaw each on 15 separate trees to estimate the economic costs of mechanical bark treatments.\r\n\r\nOur results revealed that both debarking and bark-scratching significantly decreased numbers of the emerging target pest Ips typographus to in median 4% (debarked) and 11% (scratched bark) of the number of individuals emerging from untreated control trees. Compared to control trees, debarking significantly reduced the species density of wood-inhabiting fungi, saproxylic beetles, and parasitoid wasps. By contrast, bark-scratching did not reduce the overall species density of wood-inhabiting fungi, saproxylic beetles or parasitoid wasps. The time needed for bark-scratching by machine was significantly lower than debarking, whereas bark-scratching by chainsaw needed a similar amount of time as conventional debarking. However, bark-scratching did have some negative effects in common with debarking, such as the significant reduction of wood wasps emergence holes and the reduction of holes made by foraging woodpeckers. Hence, bark-scratching of downed trees, like debarking, might affect higher trophic levels of biodiversity and should be applied only if pest management is urgently needed. We urge policy makers and natural resource managers to rapidly shift current pest management toward new techniques of bark-scratching, particularly in protected areas. Such a shift in post-disturbance pest-control will foster ecosystem integrity at lower economic cost compared to debarking.",

Uncertainty about how mesh bags used to exclude arthropods may affect decomposition rates continues to impede progress in this area. We sought to (1) measure how insects affect the decomposition of small diameter (<2.5 cm) Triadica sebifera L. \u201Ctwigs\u201D and (2) test for unintended effects of mesh bags on wood decomposition using machined wooden dowels of similar size and specific gravity. In subtropical forests, three twig diameter classes plus dowels were enclosed in two mesh sizes (0.3 or 1 mm openings) or left unenclosed over a 20-month study period. Unenclosed twigs lost significantly more mass than those within fine mesh bags. Because this effect was consistent throughout the study (reaching nearly 80% mass loss), our findings suggest the invertebrate influence does not disappear or attenuate over time. Our dowel data (limited to dowels with no evidence of insect activity) show that fine and coarse mesh bags accelerate the decomposition of enclosed woody material, suggesting insects contributed even more to the decomposition of tallow twigs than our measure of 9 \u2013 10%. Termites exhibited a strong preference for larger diameter twigs, resulting in temporary differences in decomposition rates among diameter classes. Our findings confirm the importance of insects to wood decomposition and highlight the need to incorporate these organisms in models of carbon and nutrient cycling.",

Whereas species-specific preferences for certain sediments were previously shown, the role of scales in interaction with sediment has not been investigated. Here, scale morphology and sediment friction were examined in four European pleuronectiforms: Limanda limanda, Platichthys flesus, Pleuronectes platessa, and Solea solea. All species had different scale types ranging from cycloid to ctenoid scales. On the blind side, the number of scales is higher and scales have less ctenial spines than on the eye side. The critical angle of sediment sliding (static friction) significantly depended on the grain size and was considerably higher on the eye side. The effect of mucus was excluded by repeated measurements on resin replicas of the skin. Our results demonstrate the impact of scale morphology on sediment interaction and give an insight about the ability of scales to keep sand. Exposed scales and a higher number of ctenial spines on the eye side lead to an increase of friction forces, especially for sediments with a smaller grain size. Our results suggest that the evolution of scales was at least partly driven by their interactions with sediment which confirms the relevance of sediment for the distribution and radiation of Pleuronectiformes.",

    "volume": "388","pages": "113-119","abstract": "Severe natural disturbances are common in many forest ecosystems, particularly in the Northern Hemisphere. Attempts to minimize their effects through forest management include salvage logging. In the Bohemian Forest, one of Central Europe\u2019s largest continuous forests, windstorms and bark beetle outbreaks have affected stands of Norway Spruce for centuries. Over the past decades, these natural disturbances and their management in the Bavarian Forest National Park and the adjacent Šumava National Park in the central part of the Bohemian Forest have been scientifically studied. Owing to a benign-neglect strategy, both windstorms and bark beetle outbreaks have increased stand structural heterogeneity, the amount of dead wood and light availability, which contribute to increased populations of nearly-extinct forest specialists. However, the response of a particular taxonomic group or species\r\nstrongly depends on its relationship to specific legacies that persist after disturbances. Stand climate but not dead wood appears to greatly influence the diversity of epigeal bryophytes, whereas both factors determine the diversity of epixylic bryophytes. Both the amount and heterogeneity of dead wood seems to be more important than stand climate in determining assemblages of wood-inhabiting fungi and lichens. To reduce the population density of bark beetles in the management zones of both national parks, storm-felled spruces are salvage logged, which alters a variety of these legacies and natural successional pathways. Consequently, the numbers of species of wood-inhabiting fungi, saproxylic beetles and\r\nepixylic lichens are reduced. Natural levels of biodiversity in salvage-logged areas can be preserved by (1) preserving root plates of storm-felled trees with partly retained trunks; (2) avoiding soil disturbance by using cable yarding instead of harvesters; (3) retaining sun-exposed dry branches of storm-felled trees and snags of beetle-killed spruces; (4) avoiding logging damage of natural regeneration and of large trees that survive disturbances; and (5) bark scratching instead of debarking to avoid bark beetle outbreaks while maintaining biodiversity. Windstorms and bark beetle outbreaks could be utilized to restore intensely managed forests of Central Europe to their natural composition and structure. Furthermore,\r\nexperimentally mimicked natural disturbances might help in gaining a mechanistic understanding of how natural disturbances affect biodiversity.",

We sought to determine how bark and insects contribute to decomposition in a southeastern U.S. forest. Open-topped stainless steel pans with screened bottoms were used to prevent subterranean termite (Rhinotermitidae: Reticulitermes spp.) colonization from \u201Cprotected\u201D logs. After a 20-month study period, we compared mass loss and lignin content between these and logs assigned to \u201Cunprotected\u201D treatments that permitted termite colonization. The experiment was repeated for 1) logs from which bark had or had not been initially removed and 2) logs with sealed or unsealed ends. Logs with bark lost significantly ($2.4-fold) more mass than those without bark, likely due to the moisture-conserving properties of bark. Logs with unsealed ends lost significantly more mass than those with sealed ends. There was no significant difference in mass loss between protected and unprotected logs but logs with visible termite activity lost significantly more\r\nmass than those without termite damage. Few differences in lignin content were detected in this study but when logs with bark were analyzed separately, those with visible damage from long-horned beetles (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae) had lower lignin content than those without cerambycid activity. This suggests that cerambycids may promote decomposition indirectly through interactions with fungi or other organisms capable of degrading lignin. Our results suggest that insects can have significant direct and indirect effects on wood decomposition and clearly demonstrate the importance of bark in determining wood decay rates and insect activity.",

    "volume": "204","pages": "181-188","abstract": "Restoring dead-wood amounts in forests is an increasingly and successfully applied conservation measure to counteract negative effects of intensive logging on biodiversity of saproxylic taxa. By contrast, if and how dead-wood addition benefits the vast number of non-saproxylic forest taxa, and how this varies with contextual factors like canopy openness, remains poorly understood. To enhance dead-wood addition strategies, it is thus important to understand how dead wood affects entire forests communities, not just saproxylic taxa. To untangle effects of dead-wood addition and canopy openness on non-saproxylic epigeal arthropods, we exposed different amounts of logs and branches on 190 0.1-ha plots located in sunny or shady mixed montane forests and sampled epigeal arthropods over three years. Canopy openness was a major driver of species assemblage composition and clearly mediated the effects of dead wood on epigeal beetles, spiders/harvestmen and springtails. Most species\r\ngroups responded positively to the addition of dead wood. All groups decreased in number with increasing distance to dead wood. Dead wood affected taxa of both lower and higher trophic levels directly and taxa of higher trophic levels benefitted also indirectly owing to bottom-up effects. Our results indicate that increasing the amount of dead wood for conservation of saproxylic taxa benefits also non-saproxylic epigeal arthropods and thus, a larger number of forest species than commonly assumed. Because of the strong effects of canopy openness, similar to those found for saproxylic taxa, dead wood in both sunny and shady forest stands is needed.",

    "volume": "381","pages": "188-195","abstract": "Conifer-dominated forests of the Northern Hemisphere are prone to natural disturbances, such as windstorms, which create canopy openings by downing single trees to complete stands. The size of a windthrow determines how strongly microclimatic conditions are changed. After windstorms, damaged trees are commonly logged to \u2018salvage\u2019 economic returns, but effects on biodiversity are often negative. One cause of these negative effects on biodiversity might be the alteration of storm-created microhabitats, for example, as branches are cut off and root plates are flipped back into their pits when trunks are removed. The effect of these alterations of microhabitats on biodiversity under open and closed canopies, which represent extremes of microclimatic conditions, remains unclear. To investigate the relative importance of canopy closure and microhabitats for arthropod assemblages, we created six artificial windthrows located under an open canopy and six under a closed canopy by uprooting three spruce trees per plot. We used permutational analysis of variance to test whether cutting branches off uprooted trees and allowing them to rot on the forest floor affects branch-dwelling saproxylic beetles and whether repositioning upright root plates in their pits affects assemblages of carabids, epigeal spiders and harvestmen. Our final data set comprised 7657 arthropod individuals belonging to 28 species of saproxylic beetles, 28 species of carabids, 85 species of epigeal spiders, and 8 species of harvestmen. Carabid abundance was higher under a closed canopy and the number of epigeal spider species was higher under an open canopy. Canopy closure also significantly affected the assemblage composition of saproxylic beetles, carabids and epigeal spiders, with a higher mean moisture affinity of these assemblages on plots under a closed canopy. Arthropod assemblages of root plates and root plate pits did not differ, but the composition of branch-dwelling saproxylic beetle assemblages on cut and uncut branches significantly differed. Overall, assemblages of saproxylic beetles, carabids, epigeal spiders and harvestmen were pre-dominantly determined by canopy closure and not by alteration of storm-created microhabitats. Nevertheless, entire crowns of downed spruce trees should be retained in salvage-logged forests to provide this microhabitat for saproxylic beetle assemblages typical for naturally disturbed forests.",

    "volume": "122","pages": "68-80","abstract": "Quantification of vegetation properties plays an important role in the assessment of ecosystem functions with leaf dry mater content (LDMC) and specific leaf area (SLA) being two key functional traits. For the first time, these two leaf traits have been estimated from the airborne images (HySpex) using the INFORM radiative transfer model and Continuous Wavelet Analysis (CWA). Ground truth data, were collected for 33 sample plots during a field campaign in July 2013 in the Bavarian Forest National Park, Germany, concurrent with the hyperspectral overflight. The INFORM model was used to simulate the canopy reflectance of the test site and the simulated spectra were transformed to wavelet features by applying CWA. Next, the top 1% strongly correlated wavelet features with the LDMC and SLA were used to develop predictive (regression) models. The two leaf traits were then retrieved using the CWA transformed HySpex imagery and the predictive models. The results were validated using R 2 and the RMSE of the estimated and measured variables.\r\nOur results revealed strong correlations between six wavelet features and LDMC, as well as between four wavelet features and SLA. The wavelet features at 1741 nm (scale 5) and 2281 nm (scale 4) were the two most strongly correlated with LDMC and SLA respectively. The combination of all the identified wavelet features for LDMC yielded the most accurate prediction (R 2 = 0.59 and RMSE = 4.39%). However, for SLA the most accurate prediction was obtained from the single most correlated feature: 2281 nm, scale 4 (R 2 = 0.85 and RMSE = 4.90). Our results demonstrate the applicability of Continuous Wavelet Analysis (CWA) when inverting radiative transfer models, for accurate mapping of forest leaf functional traits.",

Whether this variety is a short-term phenomenon or influences forest succession for several decades or even longer is not known. We tested the hypotheses that after spruce dieback caused by bark beetles, a high spatial heterogeneity of stand structures will persist within stands and among stands even in advanced early-seral stages and that species taxonomical and functional diversity measures will reflect this heterogeneity. We used a chronosequence of unmanaged forests in the Berchtesgaden National Park (Germany) consisting of mature undisturbed spruce stands (control), stands belonging to an initial early-seral stage (˜3 years after disturbance) and stands in an advanced early-seral stage (˜20 years after disturbance). We analysed diversity and heterogeneity of these forest stands including stand structure, species density, species composition and functional--phylogenetic diversity of vascular plants, wood-inhabiting fungi and saproxylic beetles within plots, among plots of the same successional stage and among stages. Stands of the advanced early-seral stage were characterized by a high spatial heterogeneity of structural attributes, such as crown cover, regeneration density and spatial distribution of trees. Among-plot taxonomic beta diversity was highest in the advanced early-seral stage for beetles, but lowest for fungi, while beta diversity of plants among plots remained unchanged during succession. The mosaic of successional stages initiated by bark beetles increased the gamma diversity of the study area, especially for fungi and beetles. Our findings support the hypothesis that structural heterogeneity continues for at least two decades at stand and landscape scales and that species turnover among successional stages is a major mechanism for gamma diversity in forests after bark beetle disturbance.",

    "volume": "38","pages": "12-25","abstract": "Large-scale severe natural disturbance events drive spatial and temporal patterns of forests by altering forest structure, composition, and functions. In the Bavarian Forest National Park in Germany, windthrow events led to large disturbances caused by the European bark beetle (Ips typographus L.). Until recently, it was assumed that at the initial stage of regeneration, trees tend to form a homogeneous stand structure, whereas structural heterogeneity is an attribute of later developmental stages. Yet recent studies provide evidence that under certain conditions structural heterogeneity can arise much earlier in stand development. Here we combined LiDAR data and forest growth modeling based on individual trees to develop a workflow for studying forest development in post-disturbed areas in the upper montane regions of the national park. The current forest structure was derived from LiDAR data of individually detected trees and a set of forest structural attributes were derived. The results served as input to simulate tree development spatio-temporally for a period of 80 years. Several spatial statistics, including landscape and spatial point pattern metrics, were calculated to assess the structural heterogeneity. The results showed that naturally regenerating forests on post-disturbed sites reveal structural heterogeneity already at the early-seral stage. Moreover, a significant portion of the eventual old-growth structural heterogeneity might already be determined in the early successional stages. Our workflow highlights the use of multi-sensor aerial remote sensing to provide detailed structural information useful for the investigation of early-phase forest dynamics.",

Effects of dead wood on terrestrial gastropods have been studied mostly for coarse woody debris at intermediate and advanced stages of decomposition. However, it remains unclear whether dead wood at an early stage of decomposition and of small diameter has similar positive effects on terrestrial gastropods and how effects of dead wood are mediated by canopy openness. We experimentally exposed different amounts of fresh coarse and fine woody debris on 190 temperate forest plots with either high or low canopy openness and studied terrestrial gastropod activity three years after. Plots with high canopy openness had dense herb layers. Feeding activity of gastropods was higher close than distant to dead wood. This effect was stronger on shady plots. The amount of both fine and coarse woody debris positively affected the feeding activity of gastropods, but only on shady plots. The effect of coarse woody debris amount might be partly due to increased leaf litter accumulation. Our results indicated that dead wood plays a stronger role for terrestrial gastropods in shady than in sunny forests with a dense herb layer and that terrestrial gastropods benefit from both coarse and fine woody debris already at an early stage of decomposition. Thus, conservation strategies that aim at maintaining biodiversity of saproxylic assemblages by retaining or adding dead wood are also beneficial for gastropods, especially in shady forests.",

    "volume": "136","number": "4","pages": "739-766","abstract": "Forests in Central Europe have been used since centuries and were systematically changed by silvicultural practices since the late 1700s. Focusing on possible biodiversity losses, forest stand management primarily impacts on the biodiversity attributes `composition, structure and functioning' that are interlinked and incorporate different organizational and spatial ecosystem levels. Forest stand management can manipulate tree species diversity, which in turn affects stand structure and finally leads to changes in forest functions and services. We used meta-analyses to review 49 papers with 197 comparisons on compositional and structural diversity between unmanaged and managed forests as well as 53 comparisons of biomass productivity between mixed and monoculture forests throughout the temperate biome of Europe. Besides management impacts, for species and structural comparisons, we took time since abandonment of forest stand management into consideration when dealing with unmanaged forests. For species richness and diversity, we could not detect significant management effects; no significant influences of time since abandonment of management could be identified either. Structural attributes partly revealed considerable responses to forest stand management. Importantly, deadwood quantity, the number of microhabitats, and tree size diversity were reduced by forest stand management, while no effect was found for stand basal area and the number of living trees. Some of these effects become more pronounced with increasing time since abandonment. Forest productivity was significantly enhanced by regular moderate thinning compared with untreated stands and by tree species mixing compared with monospecific stands. Based on these results, we discuss the role of direct and indirect silvicultural effects, interactions between biodiversity components, the problem of defining the unmanaged reference state, and perspectives for forest stand management in practice.",

    "volume": "164","number": "192","abstract": "Nitrogen and carbon stable isotopes provide tools to investigate ecological segregation,  prey choice and spatial distribution in seabirds. However, the interpretation of stable isotopes is frequently hampered by a lack of isotopic baseline data. In this study, two techniques proposed to overcome such shortages were tested: compound-specific isotope analyses of amino acids (AA-CSIA) and the analysis of hydrogen stable isotope ratios (HSIA). Feathers of two sympatric storm-petrels were compared. The two species, Black-bellied storm-petrels Fregetta tropica and Wilson's storm-petrels Oceanites oceanicus, moult in oceanic waters and differ in diet composition. For HSIA, a range of species with broad diet and non-breeding distribution was also investigated. Differences in carbon isotope values suggested differences in the spatial distribution and thus, in isotopic baseline values, during moult. Bulk nitrogen analyses of adult feathers did not detect species differences in trophic level. However, AA-CSIA detected clear differences in trophic levels in line with expectations: Black-bellied storm-petrels fed at a higher trophic level than Wilson`s storm-petrels. Hydrogen values also differed between the species, but contrary to expectations were highly enriched in Black-bellied storm-petrels, but much less enriched in Wilson's storm-petrels. Hydrogen data of seven petrel species challenge the suggestion that depleted $\\delta$D values indicate a higher percentage of isosmotic fish. The present results suggest that the difference in hydrogen ratios may be explained by these petrels moulting in different ocean zones. Amino acid-specific stable isotope analyses were useful for estimating isotopic baselines and thus true trophic levels, whereas hydrogen isotopes were not.",

There is broad consensus that biodiversity conservation needs to become more effective, and this requires an analysis of the causes that have prevented previous efforts from reaching their goal. A lack of knowledge exchange and cooperation between science and practice has been identified as a key issue in this context. Scientific knowledge frequently does not find its way into conservation practice, and information requirements by practitioners are often not considered appropriately by scientists. Here,\r\nwe summarize deficits and challenges in the relationship between science and practice in conservation and outline approaches to achieving more effective knowledge exchange and collaboration at the interface between both. We propose that existing platforms for communication need to be complemented by independent institutions in particular at national and sub-national levels to facilitate successful co-production of knowledge as a prerequisite for effective conservation measures.",

A group of species with a high indicator value for the naturalness of forest ecosystems are saproxylic insects. Some of these species, especially within the order Coleoptera, have been described as primeval forests relicts. Here, we compiled a list of 168 ``primeval forest relict species'' of saproxylic beetles based on expert knowledge. These species can serve as focal and umbrella species for forest conservation in Central Europe. They were selected because of their dependence on the continuous presence of primeval forest habitat features, such as over-mature trees, high amounts of dead wood, and dead wood diversity, as well as their absence in managed Central European forests. These primeval forest relict species showed a moderately strong clumping pattern within the phylogeny of beetles, as indicated by phylogenetic signal testing using the D-statistic. When we controlled for phylogenetic relatedness, an ordinal linear model revealed that large body size and preference for dead wood and trees of large diameter are the main characteristics of these species. This list of species can be used to identify forest stands of conservation value throughout Central Europe, to prioritize conservation and to raise public awareness for conservation issues related to primeval forests.",

Due to diverse microhabitat structures and conditions in tree hollows, they can support a broad range of species. However, in the past intensive management practices in parts of Europe reduced the abundance of tree hollows, resulting in a decrease and endangerment of species specialised in this tree habitat. We investigated 40 beech trees with hollows in 2014 and a subset of 23 of these trees in 2015 in a managed forest landscape in Germany. Using emergence traps we collected 89 beetle species of which 33\\% were on the Bavarian Red List. We described the tree characteristics, physical hollow characteristics, and their surrounding environment investigating their influence on $\\alpha$-diversity of non-Red List and Red List species. Furthermore, we investigated spatial (between tree hollows) and temporal (same tree hollow but different years) $\\beta$-diversity, considering the importance of turnover and nestedness components on $\\beta$-diversity. $\\alpha$-Diversity decreased with increasing decomposition of wood mould and increased with increasing area of hollow entrance in both years. Additional characteristics differed between years and between non-Red List and Red List species. $\\beta$-Diversity was related to diameter at breast height, number of surrounding tree hollows, area of hollow entrance and a temperature gradient. We found a higher species turnover than nestedness between tree hollows and between years, indicating highly dynamic beetle communities spatially as well as temporally. To support and maintain the diversity of saproxylic beetles inhabiting tree hollows, the heterogeneity of microhabitats is important and should be supported by maintaining the diversity of differently structured and sized tree hollows.",

    "volume": "409","pages": "564-570","abstract": "Vertical gradients of habitats are a typical characteristic of forest ecosystems. Sun-exposed dead wood in the upper canopy, for instance, provides a habitat for saproxylic beetles distinct from that in the more shaded dead wood below the canopy. Canopy research, however, is challenging due to both the limited accessibility and potential confounding effects of temperature on trapping probability when activity traps are used. We studied saproxylic beetle assemblages along a complete vertical gradient without bias caused by temperature effects on activity. Using crane-like constructions attached to the top of large Silver Fir trees (Abies alba), we exposed bundles of freshly cut branches of European Beech (Fagus sylvatica), Silver Fir and Norway Spruce (Picea abies) in three different vertical strata (upper canopy, mid-canopy and near the ground). The bundles in the upper canopy were fully exposed to the sun and the bundles in the mid-canopy and near the ground were in the shade. We allowed beetles to colonize the bundles of branches for one growing period and then reared beetles from each bundle over three years. The species composition of saproxylic beetle assemblages differed between bundles in the upper canopy and near the ground; bundles in the mid-canopy had an intermediate assemblage composition. The abundance of saproxylic beetles was higher near the ground than in the upper canopy, whereas the number of species showed the opposite pattern. Overlapping confidence intervals of sample-based rarefaction and extrapolation curves for species diversity indicate that estimated gamma diversity per stratum is similar across the three strata. Our results support earlier studies that revealed the importance of habitat heterogeneity as a driver of the biodiversity of taxa associated with dead wood. As we controlled for wood diameter and tree species diversity, our study suggests that the microclimatic variability within dead wood \u2013 and thus habitat heterogeneity for saproxylic beetles \u2013 is higher in the upper canopy than near the ground. For biodiversity conservation in forests, our results support a strategy of enhancing the number of trees with microhabitats, particularly those with dead branches in the upper tree crown. Dead branches and standing dead trees should only be removed, e.g. for safety reasons, if no other option is available.",

The Arabuko Sokoke forest represents the largest remnant of East African coastal forest. Despite conservation efforts to maintain biodiversity in this forest, populations of several species are declining, including flagship species like the endemic Sokoke Scops Owl Otus ireneae. In this study, we assessed the presence of O. ireneae based on playback technique to identify the occurrence of this species across the forest. We then analysed habitat parameters at sites occupied and non-occupied by the owl species. Our data show that O. ireneae occurs restricted to one single forest type, the Cynometra woodland. Results obtained from parametric one-way ANOVA and structural equation modelling reveal that large old Cynometra webberi trees and dead wood are key requirements for the occurrence of this owl species. However, large C. webberi trees are currently illegally logged by the forest adjacent human population to produce timber, carvings, poles. Charcoal and dead wood represents a major energy source for households. Otus ireneae, being the smallest owl of East Africa may serve as a charismatic flag ship species to promote conservation of this endangered coastal forest, and furthermore as umbrella to conserve other forest species with similar habitat requirements.",

While such restorations are widespread, rigorous evaluations of their success are rare. This is especially true of those considering species dynamics. Increasingly, deadwood is a target for forest restoration as many species directly and indirectly\r\ndepend on this resource.\r\n2.\t In a broadleaf forest in southern Germany, we explored the effect of landscape\u2010wide deadwood restoration on the population genetic structure of the specialist fungus\u2010dwelling saproxylic beetle Bolitophagus reticulatus. Before 2003, the northern area of this forest was intensively logged for more than half a century, while the southern part was less intensively managed. This drove populations of the host fungus Fomes fomentarius, and consequently the beetle, to local extinction in the northern part. Only after the first decade of restoration were both the fungus and its beetles present across all areas of the forest.\r\n3.\t Using 17 newly developed microsatellite loci, we show that these beetles exhibit population genetic structuring, mainly influenced by the north\u2010south divide. However, the low degree of isolation\u2010by\u2010distance, and the low relatedness of beetles collected from the same trees or fungus, shows that strong dispersal ability is\r\nfacilitating the recolonisation of these forests on the scale of tens of kilometers. In another 10 years, it is likely that the population will show even less genetic structuring.\r\n4.\t Synthesis and applications. Through the recolonisation of the fungus Fomes fomentarius and the fungus\u2010dwelling beetle Bolitophagus reticulatus after deadwood restoration, we demonstrate that, while there are many discussions on the optimal spatial distribution of deadwood, just the presence of deadwood can be sufficient to enable recolonisations of specific species. As long as some relict populations of these species are embedded in a once intensively managed forest, increased deadwood (amount and diversity) anywhere will benefit recolonisation of the habitat. However, increasing deadwood diversity should also be encouraged to benefit even more species.",

However, understanding relationships between faunal diversity and measurable ecosystem quantities, such as heterogeneity and productivity, across continental scales can be complicated by disparate methods. We developed standardized ap-\r\nproaches using lidar data and spectral greenness data (via NDVI; Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) from 637 sampling plots across four sites in North America, Europe, and Asia to test the local effects of habitat heterogeneity and productivity on taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity of breeding bird assemblages using boosted generalized additive models. Our results revealed the 3-D (three dimensional) vegetation structure (horizontal and vertical) to be of similar importance as NDVI in multiple biodiversity measures, and the importance of 3-D structure was higher for functional and phylogenetic biodiversity measures than for taxonomic measures. We found congruent responses between functional and phylogenetic diversity; however, patterns of taxonomic diversity differed from those of functional/phylogenetic diversity for most predictors. For\r\nexample, NDVI had positive relationships with taxonomic diversity, but negative relationships with functional/phylogenetic diversity. The effect of canopy density on taxonomic diversity was generally bell-shaped, whereas the relationship was U-shaped for functional and phylogenetic diversity. As a result, this study supports a silviculture strategy with a high variety of canopy densities and vertical variabilities across forest stands to create maximum benefits for regional biodiversity. Here, early succession stands and closed stands sustain functionally-rich bird assemblages, while stands with a medium canopy density promote species-rich assemblages.",

Our understanding of the importance of macroclimate and local factors determining their taxonomic diversity has increased, but determinants of functional and phylogenetic diversity are poorly understood. We investigated assemblages of wood-inhabiting fungi and saproxylic beetles along a 1000 m elevational gradient of a temperate low mountain range. We (i) tested the relative importance of macroclimate (i.e. elevation) and local variables (microclimate, i.e. canopy closure, amount and diversity of dead wood) in determining observed and rarefied diversities and (ii) explored whether determinants of observed functional and phylogenetic diversities match those of taxonomic diversity. For both taxa, the determinants of observed phylogenetic and functional diversities largely matched those of taxonomic diversity. The diversity of wood-inhabiting fungi was predominantly determined by local variables, whereas that of saproxylic beetles was determined by both local variables and elevation. Taxonomic and phylogenetic diversities of saproxylic beetles decreased with increasing elevation, but standardized functional richness and entropy of both groups increased with increasing elevation. Diversities of wood-inhabiting fungi increased with canopy closure, while diversities of saproxylic beetles decreased with increasing canopy closure. Microclimate and dead-wood amount and diversity affected the observed and rarefied diversity of both saproxylic taxa, which justifies conservation actions that focus on attributes of dead wood and canopy cover. The contrasting responses of fungi and beetles highlight the need for amounts of diverse dead wood in the various microclimates to preserve functional and phylogenetic diversities of saproxylic organisms.",

Understanding how forest stand attributes influence the distribution of these specialists has hence become a prerequisite for sustainable forest management. In this study, we evaluated the conservation value of managed forests for old-growth forest specialists using the poorly studied Semi-collared Flycatcher as an example. We applied a boosted generalized additive model to identify forest characteristics that determine the occurrence of the bird in Bulgaria. We found that on a national scale, forest stand age and percent cover of broad-leaved forests best explain the breeding distribution of the flycatcher. Although, forest stands became suitable habitat at an age of around 70\u202Fyears for this species, stands in the interior forest featuring trees older than 160\u202Fyears and composed of more than 80% broad-leaved trees were preferred by the species. At a local scale, the amount of dead wood positively influenced nest site choice of the flycatcher. In total, 22.3% of all studied broad-leaved forests in Bulgaria showed a predicted habitat suitability higher than 50%. High-stem forests that are old enough to develop old-growth characteristics had the highest potential to serve as habitat for the Semi-collared Flycatcher in Bulgaria. Therefore, we conclude that a decrease in logging of forests stands older than 160\u202Fyears decreases the risk of decline of the Semi-collared Flycatcher.",

Conservation has largely focused only on selected stages of forest succession (e.g., late-­seral stages). However, to develop\r\ncomprehensive conservation strategies and to understand the impact of forest management on biodiversity, a quantitative understanding of how different trophic groups vary over the course of succession is needed.\r\n2.\t We classified mixed mountain forests in Central Europe into nine successional stages using airborne LiDAR. We analysed α-­ and β-­diversity of six trophic groups encompassing approximately 3,000 species from three kingdoms. We quantified the effect of successional stage on the number of species with and without con-\r\ntrolling for species abundances and tested whether the data fit the more-individuals hypothesis or the habitat heterogeneity hypothesis. Furthermore, we analysed the similarity of assemblages along successional development.\r\n3.\t The abundance of producers, first-­order consumers, and saprotrophic species showed a U-­shaped response to forest succession. The number of species of producer and consumer groups generally followed this U-­shaped pattern. In contrast to our expectation, the number of saprotrophic species did not change along succession. When we controlled for the effect of abundance, the number of producer and saproxylic beetle species increased linearly with forest succession, whereas the U-­shaped response of the number of consumer species persisted. The analysis of assemblages indicated a large contribution of succession-­mediated β-­diversity to regional γ-­diversity.\r\n4.\t Synthesis and applications. Depending on the species group, our data supported both the more-individuals hypothesis and the habitat heterogeneity hypothesis. Our results highlight the strong influence of forest succession on biodiversity and underline the importance of controlling for successional dynamics when assessing\r\nbiodiversity change in response to external drivers such as climate change. The successional stages with highest diversity (early and late successional stages) are currently strongly underrepresented in the forests of Central Europe. We thus recommend that conservation strategies aim at a more balanced representation of all successional stages.",

There are many hurdles that challenge multitrophic approaches and we discuss solutions to overcome these.

These forests have been affected by humans for millennia, in contrast to the Hyrcanian forests south of the Caspian Sea, with their numerous old-growth features and endemic species. How the tree host species in this temperate relict of Tertiary forests affects saproxylic biodiversity is unknown, as an inventory of the saproxylic fauna present is incomplete, and new species are still being described. To analyze the importance of four dominant tree species in this region (Fagus orientalis, Quercus castaneifolia, Alnus subcordata, and Carpinus betulus), we sampled saproxylic beetles and true bugs with flight-interception traps at five dead trees per host species. We identified 361 beetle and 7 true bug species; of these, 268 were saproxylic, 56 were endemic, 11 were Central European ``primeval-forest relicts'', and at least 16 species were undescribed. Rarefaction-extrapolation curves indicated higher species richness of saproxylic beetles and true bugs on F. orientalis and C. betulus than on A. subcordata and Q. castaneifolia, but ordination showed that communities were most distinct on Q. castaneifolia. Higher species richness on C. betulus and F. orientalis compared to Q. castaneifolia was unexpected based on literature but is in line with recent findings of experimental studies from Central Europe. Our results underline previous findings on the importance of moribund trees and dead wood in the Hyrcanian forests, and thereby support current efforts of Iranian authorities to stop the removal of veteran trees. The complementary fauna on oak trees compared to the other three tree species illustrates the importance of fragments of the almost destroyed oak forests along the coastline for forest biodiversity conservation in the Hyrcanian region.",

    "volume": "226","pages": "81-91","abstract": "Boreal and mountainous forests are a primary focus of conservation efforts and are naturally prone to large-scale disturbances, such as outbreaks of bark beetles. Affected stands are characterised by biological legacies which persist through the disturbance and subsequent succession. The lack of long-term monitoring data on post-disturbance forest structure precludes understanding of the complex pathways by which natural disturbances affect forest structure and subsequently species presence. We analysed the response of capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus) and hazel grouse (Tetrastes bonasia) to bark beetle infestations. We combined high-resolution airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) with a 23-year time series of aerial photography to quantify present-day\r\nforest structure and stand disturbance history. Species presence was assessed by collecting droppings of hazel grouse and capercaillie in a citizen science project. Structural equation models showed that the probability of hazel grouse presence increased with increasing disturbance, and the probability of both hazel grouse and capercaillie presence increased with succession. Indirect effects of bark beetle infestations, such as a reduced abundance of deciduous trees and an enhanced herb layer cover, were positively associated with capercaillie presence. Decreasing canopy cover increased the probability of hazel grouse presence. The high temporal and\r\nspatial heterogeneity of bark beetle infestations created forest structures that meet the contrasting habitat requirements of both, capercaillie and hazel grouse. This heterogeneity resulted from biological legacies such as decomposing snags, and the simultaneous regrowth of natural regeneration. A benign-neglect strategy towards bark beetle infestations could hence foster capercaillie and hazel grouse in mountainous forests.",

To cope with the multiple challenges related to global change but also to further improve forest management we need a better understanding of (1) the linkages between drivers of ecosystem change and the state and management of forest ecosystems as well as their capacity to adapt to ongoing global environmental changes, and (2) the interrelationships within and between the components of forest ecosystems. To address the resulting challenges for the state of forest ecosystems in Central Europe, we suggest 45 questions for future ecological research. We define forest ecology as studies on the abiotic and biotic components of forest ecosystems and their interactions on varying spatial and temporal scales. Our questions cover five thematic fields and correspond to the criteria selected for describing the state of Europe\u2019s forests by policy makers, i.e. biogeochemical cycling, mortality and disturbances, productivity, biodiversity and biotic interactions, and regulation and protection. We conclude that an improved mechanistic understanding of forest ecosystems is essential for the further development of ecosystem-oriented multifunctional forest management in the face of accelerating global change.",

Although a benign neglect strategy of dealing with natural disturbances in protected areas is beneficial for nature, public debate on avoiding increased pest population growth has intensified. We evaluated the effect of mechanical pest control measures in decreasing populations of insect pests, maintaining nontarget biodiversity, retaining high recreational value, and keeping economic costs low. Debarking and bark scratching or gouging effectively prevented infestation of felled trees by European spruce bark beetles (Ips typographus) and controlled the beetles in recently infested trees. Bark scratching or gouging retained biodiversity at natural levels, whereas debarking decreased biodiversity by 54% with higher economic costs. The public rated bark-gouged trees more positively than debarked trees. We thus urge authorities to promote bark scratching or gouging in the control of bark beetles in protected areas instead of salvage logging and debarking.",

We assessed the effects of nine forest features (representing stand structure, heterogeneity and tree composition) on thirteen above- and belowground trophic groups of plants, animals, fungi and bacteria in 150 temperate forest plots differing in their management type. Canopy cover decreased light resources, which increased community specialisation but reduced overall diversity and abundance. Features increasing resource types and diversifying microhabitats (admixing of oaks and conifers) were important and mostly affected richness. Belowground groups responded differently to those aboveground and had weaker responses to most forest features. Our results show that we need to consider forest features rather than broad management types and highlight the importance of considering several groups and community dimensions to better inform conservation.",

The new method refines and improves on the conventional species-equivalent approach in three areas: (i) the conventional method often gives similar values (close to unity) to assemblages with contrasting levels of functional diversity; (ii) when a distance metric is unbounded, the conventional functional diversity depends on the presence/absence of other assemblages in the study; (iii) in partitioning functional gamma diversity into alpha and beta components, the conventional gamma is sometimes less than alpha. To resolve these issues, we add to the attribute-diversity framework a novel concept: τ - the threshold of functional distinctiveness between any two species; here τ can be chosen to be any positive value. Any two species with functional distance ≥ τ are treated as functionally equally-distinct. Our functional diversity quantifies the effective number of functionally equally-distinct species (or \u201Cvirtual functional groups\u201D) with all pairwise distances at least τ for different-species pairs. We advocate the use of two complementary diversity profiles (τ-profile and q-profile), which depict functional diversity with varying levels of τ and q, respectively. Both the conventional species-equivalent method (i.e., τ = the maximum of species-pairwise distances) and classic taxonomic diversity (i.e., τ = the minimum of non-zero species-pairwise distances) are incorporated into our proposed τ-profile for an assemblage. For any type of species-pairwise distance matrices, our attribute-diversity approach allows proper diversity partitioning, with the desired property gammaalpha and thus avoids all the restrictions that apply to the conventional diversity decomposition. Our functional alpha and gamma are interpreted as the effective numbers\r\n- 2 -of functionally equally-distinct species, respectively, in an assemblage and in the pooled\r\nassemblage, while beta is the effective number of equally-large assemblages with no shared\r\nspecies and all species in the assemblages being equally-distinct. The resulting beta diversity can be transformed to obtain abundance-sensitive Sørensen- and Jaccard-type functional (dis)similarity profiles. Hypothetical and real examples are used to illustrate the framework. Online software and R codes are available to facilitate computations.",

In this study, we evaluated whether deadwood enrichment as an integrative strategy at a scale of 17,000\u202Fha resulted in enhanced biodiversity of saproxylic and non-saproxylic taxa eight years after the implementation of the strategy. The strategy included active deadwood enrichment with harvest remnants, retention of deadwood, and nature forest reserves areas. The analysis was based on data on the occurrence of plants, fungi, beetles, true bugs and birds from directly before and after the implementation of the strategy. The implementation of the strategy resulted in an increase in the deadwood amount by an average of 90\u202F±\u202F40\u202Fm3\u202Fha−1 (mean\u202F±\u202FSE) over this period. While deadwood amounts doubled in production forests (+90%), they increased even more in nature forest reserves (+160%). Multidiversity (species density of all taxa) increased with an increase in deadwood amount; this was a result of an increase in the multidiversity of saproxylic species as the non-saproxylic multidiversity did not respond. Among single taxon groups, fungal and beetle species density responded positively to the increase in deadwood amount, especially when only saproxylic species were analysed. Importantly, this effect was not only found in the nature forest reserves, but also in the production forests. We thus conclude that active deadwood enrichment in production forests and nature forest reserves is a promising tool to rapidly promote the protection of forest biodiversity.",

    "volume": "10","number": "12","abstract": "Forest biodiversity conservation requires precise, area-wide information on the abundance and distribution of key habitat structures at multiple spatial scales. We combined airborne laser scanning (ALS) data with color-infrared (CIR) aerial imagery for identifying individual tree characteristics and quantifying multi-scale habitat requirements using the example of the three-toed woodpecker (Picoides tridactylus) (TTW) in the Bavarian Forest National Park (Germany). This bird, a keystone species of boreal and mountainous forests, is highly reliant on bark beetles  dwelling in dead or dying trees. While previous studies showed a positive relationship between the TTW presence and the amount of deadwood as a limiting resource, we hypothesized a unimodal response with a negative effect of very high deadwood amounts and \r\ntested for effects of substrate quality. Based on 104 woodpecker presence or absence locations, habitat selection was modelled at four spatial scales reflecting different woodpecker home range sizes. The abundance of standing dead trees was the most important predictor, with an increase in the probability of TTW occurrence up to a threshold of 44\u201350 dead trees per hectare, followed by a decrease in the probability of occurrence. A positive relationship with the deadwood crown size indicated the importance of fresh deadwood. Remote sensing data allowed both an area-wide prediction of species occurrence and the derivation of ecological threshold values for deadwood quality and quantity for more informed conservation management.",

    "pages": "1-54","abstract": "Concern about the functional consequences of unprecedented loss in biodiversity has prompted biodiversity\u2013ecosystem functioning (BEF) research to become one of the most active fields of ecological research in the past 25 years. Hundreds of experiments have manipulated biodiversity as an independent variable and found compelling support that the functioning of ecosystems increases with the diversity of their ecological communities. This research has also identified some of the mechanisms underlying BEF relationships, some context-dependencies of the strength of relationships, as well as implications for various ecosystem services that mankind depends upon. In this chapter, we argue that a multitrophic perspective of biotic interactions in random and non-random biodiversity change scenarios is key to advance future BEF research and to address some of its most important remaining challenges. We discuss that\r\nthe study and the quantification of multitrophic interactions in space and time facilitates\r\nscaling up from small-scale biodiversity manipulations and ecosystem function assessments to management-relevant spatial scales across ecosystem boundaries. We specifically consider multitrophic conceptual frameworks to understand and predict the context-dependency of BEF relationships. Moreover, we highlight the importance of the eco-evolutionary underpinnings of multitrophic BEF relationships. We outline that FAIR data (meeting the standards of findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability) and reproducible processing will be key to advance this field of research by making it more integrative. Finally, we show how these BEF insights may be implemented for ecosystem management, society, and policy. Given that human well-being critically depends on the multiple services provided by diverse, multitrophic communities, integrating the approaches of evolutionary ecology, community ecology, and ecosystem ecology in future BEF research will be key to refine conservation targets and develop sustainable management strategies.",

The fungus, however, has regionally declined due to centuries of logging. To unravel biogeographical drivers of arthropod communities associ\u2010\r\nated with this fungus, we investigated how space, climate and habitat amount structure alpha and beta diversity of arthropod communities in fruitbodies of F. fomentarius.\r\nLocation: Temperate zone of Europe.\r\nTaxon: Arthropods.\r\nMethods: We reared arthropods from fruitbodies sampled from 61 sites throughout the range of European beech and identified 13 orders taxonomically or by metabarcoding. We estimated the total number of species occurring in fruitbodies of F. fomentarius in European beech forests using the Chao2 estimator and determined the relative importance of space, climate and habitat amount by hierarchical partitioning for alpha diversity and generalized dissimilarity models for beta diversity. A subset of fungi samples was sequenced for identification of the fungus\u2019 genetic structure.\r\nResults: The total number of arthropod species occurring in fruitbodies of F. fomentarius across European beech forests was estimated to be 600. Alpha diversity increased with increasing fruitbody biomass; it decreased with increasing longitude, temperature and latitude. Beta diversity was mainly composed by turnover. Patterns of beta diversity were only weakly linked to space and the overall explanatory power was low. We could distinguish two genotypes of F. fomentarius, which showed no spatial structuring.\r\nMain conclusion: Fomes fomentarius hosts a large number of arthropods in European beech forests. The low biogeographical and climatic structure of the communities suggests that fruitbodies represent a habitat that offers similar conditions across large gradients of climate and space, but are characterized by high local variability in community composition and colonized by species with high dispersal ability. For European beech forests, retention of trees with F. fomentarius and promoting its recolonization where it had declined seems a promising conservation strategy.",

However, since they are restricted to ephemeral habitats, colonizing new patches should benefit from dispersal by animals with similar habitat preferences because the directed, resource-searching movement of animals increases the likelihood of reaching suitable habitats. Here we determine which fungal guilds are carried by wood-inhabiting beetles and what influences beetle-associated fungal communities. High-throughput sequencing identified >1800 fungal taxa from beetle communities that emerged from 64 experimental logs. Beetle-associated fungi included mutualistic, decomposing, pathogenic and mycorrhizal fungi; decomposers were the most diverse. Partial-procrustes analysis revealed that the total\r\nbeetle-associated community and mutualists were correlated (p 0.05) with beetle community\r\ncomposition and decomposers were marginally correlated (p 0.10) with beetle community composition. All three groups were marginally correlated with the total fungal communities that inhabit the dead wood. Our results show that beetles carry a broad range of wood-inhabiting fungi and beetle-associated fungal communities are determined by environmental factors and the vectoring beetle community and to some degree by the fungal source community. This suggests that wood-inhabiting beetles contribute to fungal dispersal, including directed dispersal, which could affect fungal community assembly and ecosystem processes like wood decomposition.",

Relatively little is known about the formation and decomposition of CWD by microbial communities in situ and about the factors controlling the associated processes. In this study, we intensively analyzed the molecular fungal community composition and species richness in relation to extracellular enzyme activity and differences in decomposing sapwood and heartwood of 13 temperate tree species (four coniferous and nine deciduous species, log diameter 30\u201340 cm and 4 m long) in an artificial experiment involving placing the logs on the forest soil for six years. We observed strong differences in the molecular fungal community composition and richness among the 13 tree species, and specifically between deciduous and coniferous wood, but unexpectedly no difference was found between sapwood and heartwood. Fungal species richness correlated positively with wood extractives and negatively with fungal biomass. A distinct fungal community secreting lignocellulolytic key enzymes seemed to dominate the decomposition of the logs in this specific phase. In particular, the relative sequence abundance of basidiomycetous species of the Meruliaceae (e.g. Bjerkandera adusta) correlated with ligninolytic manganese peroxidase activity. Moreover, this study reveals abundant white-rot causing Basidiomycota and soft-rot causing Ascomycota during this phase of wood decomposition.",

To assess their value for biodiversity, we compared beetle communities among three anthropogenic land use types, namely spruce plantations, Christmas tree plantations and maize fields. These three land use types are all characterised by high phytobiomass and vertical plant structure and represent a gradient of anthropogenic impact linked to fertilisation, pesticide use, frequent operation of machinery and rotation period length. We found that all components of beetle diversity, i.e. abundance, number of species and Simpson diversity as well as the number of threatened beetle species decreased with increasing anthropogenic impact from spruce plantations to Christmas tree plantations to maize fields. However, beetle biomass was relatively high in maize fields, due to the abundant species in this land use type having a high body mass. Community composition changed with anthropogenic impact. Beetle communities in maize fields were characterised by a higher frequency of zoophagous beetles and a lower frequency of saprophagous/mycetophagous and xylophagous beetles than those in Christmas tree plantations and spruce plantations. The low value of maize fields for beetle biodiversity is concerning because the area covered by maize increased over the last decade by 26.7\\% and now constitutes 13.5\\% of arable land globally.",

Therefore, interventions aiming to increase DW might be necessary to support its associated biodiversity, even in protected forests, which may be former production forests. Our aim was to synthesize the current state of knowledge drawn from replicated experimental studies into solid quantitative evidence of the effects of DW manipulation on forest biodiversity, with a focus on protected forests.\r\n2.\t We conducted a full systematic review of effects of DW manipulation on forest biodiversity in boreal and temperate regions. We included three intervention types: creation of DW from live trees at the site, addition of DW from outside the site and prescribed burning. Outcomes included abundance and species richness of saproxylic insects, ground insects, wood\u2010inhabiting fungi, lichens, reptiles and cavity\u2010nesting birds. In total, we included 91 studies, 37 of which were used in meta\u2010analyses.\r\n3.\t Although meta\u2010analysis outcomes were heterogeneous, they showed that increasing the amount of DW (\u201CDW enrichment\u201D) has positive effects on the abundance and richness of saproxylic insects and fungi. The positive effect on saproxylic pest insect abundance tended to be less than that on saproxylic insects in general. No significant effects were found for ground insects or cavity\u2010nesting birds.\r\n4.\t Although reviewed studies were mainly short term, our results support that management that increases DW amounts has the potential to increase the abundance of DW\u2010dependent species and, in most cases, also their species richness. Studies of burning showed positive effects on the abundance of saproxylic insects similar to those of other interventions, even though burning on average resulted in a smaller enrichment of DW amounts.\r\n5.\t Policy implications. The findings of the review suggest that manipulating dead wood (DW) can be an effective part of conservation management to support biodiversity in protected areas. The findings also indicate that the diversity of DW types is important, a mix of DW qualities should be favoured. Burning seems to be an effective method to increase biodiversity but to benefit cavity\u2010nesting birds, snag losses need to be minimized.",

The\r\ndominance of beech in these forests developed during the ongoing post-­glacial northward re-­colonization, concurrently with intensified forest use by humans. We investigated how these two processes together with climate shaped the patterns of functional diversity of two major species groups involved in wood decomposition and whether functional diversity is determined on the local or regional species pool level.\r\nLocation: European beech forest distribution range.\r\nTaxon: Saproxylic beetles and fungi.\r\nMethods: We analysed records of 532,496 saproxylic beetles of 788 species and 8,630 records of 234 saproxylic fungal species based on sets of traits similar to both groups. We tested how space, climate and landscape composition affect trait-­based functional diversity on local and regional scales. Using structural equation modelling, we tested whether functional diversity is shaped on the local or regional scale.\r\nResults: The response of local functional diversity of both saproxylic beetles and fungi followed a highly congruent pattern of decreasing functional diversity towards the north, with higher elevation and accounted for overall geographical gradients with higher temperature, while increasing with higher precipitation. Structural equation modelling revealed that local functional diversity is determined by community changes operating on the level of the regional species pool.\r\nMain conclusions: Our findings suggest that the functional diversity patterns of saproxylic organisms in European beech forests are mainly determined on the regional scale and driven by anthropogenic and biogeographical processes. To conserve the variation and hotspots of functional diversity in beech forests, activities have to focus on a broad spatial and climatic range of sites throughout Europe, including the primeval forests in the east, as started by the UNESCO World Heritage selection of \u201CAncient and Primeval Beech Forests of the Carpathians and Other Regions of Europe\u201D.",

    "volume": "437","pages": "232-245","abstract": "Herbivorous insects play an important role in forest ecosystems, but their response to forest management is not well known. We tested how various aspects of forest management affect the abundance and species richness as well as the community composition of herbivorous insects in temperate European forests, applying a large scale approach that included 126 forests in three regions, two forest strata (understory and canopy), and three herbivorous guilds (xylophages, leaf chewers, plant suckers). Forest management was characterized by a recently developed silvicultural management index, stand developmental stage, and dominating tree species. We sampled more than 44,710 individuals of 698 species of herbivorous Coleoptera and Hemiptera. Overall, forest management caused shifts in herbivore community composition. Responses of abundances and species richness varied between feeding guilds and forest strata. Forest management intensity had opposing effects on herbivores in the two forest strata, with abundances tending to be negatively affected in the canopy layer but positively in the understory. Effects on species richness were weak overall and only significant in plant suckers, with slightly higher species richness at high management intensities. Stand developmental stage of beech forests mainly impacted plant suckers, with abundance increasing with stand age. However, a general positive effect of stand age on forest herbivores can be suggested, as abundances of all feeding guilds responded positively to stand biomass. Oak forests were found to harbor a significantly higher species richness of leaf chewers and the highest abundance of plant suckers compared to all other stands. And while canopies of pine stands exhibited low abundances of leaf chewers, they were found to have positive effects on plant sucker species richness compared to pure beech stands. Our results show that management intensity significantly alters the species composition and abundances of forest herbivores, albeit effects vary depending on forest stratum. This strongly suggests that the forest canopy needs to be considered for a reliable estimation of the consequences of forest management on herbivorous insects. Decisions on tree species composition should be made diligently, as they have significant impact on the abundance and species richness of some forest herbivores and, consequently, also on the ecosystem processes they shape.",

While recent research revealed that aboveground insect herbivory generally impacts the outcome of PSFs, no study tested to what extent the intensity of herbivory affects the outcome. This, however, is essential to estimate the contribution of PSFs to plant performance under natural conditions in the field. Here, we tested PSF effects both with and without exposure to aboveground herbivory for four common grass species in nine grasslands that formed a gradient of aboveground invertebrate herbivory. Without aboveground herbivores, PSFs for each of the four grass species were similar in each of the nine grasslands---both in direction and in magnitude. In the presence of herbivores, however, the PSFs differed from those measured under herbivory exclusion, and depended on the intensity of herbivory. At low levels of herbivory, PSFs were similar in the presence and absence of herbivores, but differed at high herbivory levels. While PSFs without herbivores remained similar along the gradient of herbivory intensity, increasing herbivory intensity mostly resulted in neutral PSFs in the presence of herbivores. This suggests that the relative importance of PSFs for plant-species performance in grassland communities decreases with increasing intensity of herbivory. Hence, PSFs might be more important for plant performance in ecosystems with low herbivore pressure than in ecosystems with large impacts of insect herbivores.",

    "volume": "205","number": "5","pages": "735-743","abstract": "In the Mediterranean region, a group of unrelated plant species share an unusual deep-red flower color and are pollinated by glaphyrid beetles. Some of these species possess different color morphs, but the mechanisms maintaining this color polymorphism are unknown. The peacock anemone, Anemone pavonina, is a color polymorphic species with red or purple flowers. We investigated the spatial distribution of its color morphs and its potential glaphyrid pollinators, Pygopleurus spp., along an elevational gradient on the southern slopes of Mount Olympus, Greece. We found a correlation between relative proportions of the two color morphs with both elevation and beetle abundance. At low elevations (<þinspace1000 m a.s.l.), beetles were abundant and anemone populations comprised only red flowers. Above a steep transition zone with mixed-colored populations (c. 1000--1300 m) most flowers were purple and beetles were rare. Color-trapping experiments revealed a strong preference for red over other colors in beetles and colorimetric modeling suggests that a simple chromatic mechanism is sufficient to explain their color choices. We thus hypothesize that beetles select for red flowers and that with increasing elevation and decreasing beetle density, other flower visitors (e.g., bees) gain importance as pollinators and select for a different color.",

    "volume": "451","abstract": "Humans have widely extirpated large carnivores and simultaneously promoted overabundance of deer. The intense pressure imposed by these herbivores in forests has led to extremely low rates of natural forest regeneration. In natural old-growth forests, deadwood functions as a key driver of biodiversity and promotes ecosystem functioning, such as water retention and nutrient recycling. An as yet unappreciated function of deadwood is its ability to act as a physical barrier, excluding large herbivores from the obstructed patches and thereby reducing browsing pressure. However, this benefit may be minimized by an increase in rodent herbivory in the sheltered patches. In this study, a field experiment was conducted in a total of 384 plots in which tree crowns (0\u20134) from logging residuals were used as increasingly dense physical barriers to shelter five newly planted saplings of silver fir (Abies alba Mill.). Generalized linear mixed-effects models were applied to determine whether sapling browsing by roe deer and rodents was differentially affected by these barriers. The probability of roe deer browsing decreased from 26% (no crowns) to 2% (4 crowns) while that of rodent browsing increased from 1% to 17%, respectively, as the number of deadwood crowns used in barrier construction increased. In broadleaf stands, browsing by roe deer and rodents was generally higher than in coniferous stands. In forests with high numbers of visitors, browsing by roe deer was reduced, but browsing by rodents was not influenced. The retention of large amounts of deadwood or active deadwood increments may thus provide an effective barrier to roe deer browsing but promote the browsing activity of rodents. The landscape-level heterogeneity of browsing patterns associated with the presence of deadwood suggests that deadwood shelters in homogenized forests may encourage both natural forest regeneration and forest biodiversity, despite an overabundance of roe deer.",

Rarefaction/extrapolation approaches can quantify within-habitat biodiversity, but may not be useful for cases in which one habitat type is progressively transformed into another habitat type. To quantify biodiversity patterns in such transformed landscapes, we use Hill numbers to analyse individual-based species abundance data or replicated, sample-based incidence data. Given biodiversity data from two distinct habitat types, when a specified proportion of original habitat is transformed, our approach utilises a proportional mixture of two within-habitat rarefaction/extrapolation curves to analytically predict biodiversity changes, with bootstrap confidence intervals to assess sampling uncertainty. We also derive analytic formulas for assessing species composition (i.e. the numbers of shared and unique species) for any mixture of the two habitat types. Our analytical and numerical analyses revealed that species unique to each habitat type are the most important determinants of landscape biodiversity patterns.",

The resulting routine use of underpowered designs could lead to a systematic underestimation of insecticide effects on nontarget arthropod communities. We tested the use of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) for experimental insecticide applications at tree level to increase replication in cost-efficient way. We assessed the effects of two forestry insecticides, diflubenzuron (DFB) and tebufenozide (TBF), on the oak defoliator, Thaumetopoea processionea (Linnaeus)  (Lepidoptera: Thaumetopoeidae), and on nontarget, tree-living Lepidoptera. Individual trees were sprayed with either insecticide or left unsprayed, in a fully factorial design involving 60 trees. Caterpillars fallen from tree crowns were sampled as a measure of mortality, while caterpillar feeding activity was monitored by collecting frass\r\ndroppings. Both DFB and TBF led to greater mortality of T. processionea and lower Lepidoptera feeding activity than control levels. TBF caused measurable mortality in nontarget groups, affecting Macrolepidoptera more strongly than Microlepidoptera, while there was no significant side effect of DFB. The high treatment efficacy against the target pest indicates that UAV technology is well-suited for the application of insecticide in forests. We detected distinct responses to different insecticides among nontarget groups and suggest there is an influence of application timing and biological traits in these differences, emphasizing the need for more ecologically orientated risk assessment. UAV-supported designs can be used to link laboratory bioassays and large-scale experiments, allowing for more comprehensive assessments of insecticide effects in forest ecosystems.",

However, the mechanisms by which bark determines the assembly process and biodiversity of decomposers remain unknown. Therefore, we partially or completely removed bark from experimentally felled trees and tested with null modelling whether assembly processes were determined by bark coverage and if biodi-\r\nversity of molecularly sampled fungi and bacteria generally benefited from increasing bark cover. The community composition of fungi, wood-decaying fungi (subset of all fungi) and bacteria clearly separated between completely debarked, partly debarked and control trees. Bacterial species richness was higher on control trees than on either partly or completely debarked trees, whereas the species richness of all fungi did not differ. However, the species\r\nrichness of wood-decaying fungi was higher on partially and completely debarked trees than on control trees. Deterministic assembly processes were most important in completely debarked trees, a pattern consistent for fungi and bacteria. Our findings suggest that human disturbances in forests shift the dominant assembly mechanism from stochastic to deterministic processes and thus alter the diversity of wood-inhabiting microorganisms.",

    "volume": "10","number": "1","abstract": "Thermal melanism theory states that dark-colored ectotherm organisms are at an advantage\r\nat low temperature due to increased warming. This theory is generally supported for ectotherm animals, however, the function of colors in the fungal kingdom is largely unknown. Here, we test whether the color lightness of mushroom assemblages is related to climate using a dataset of 3.2 million observations of 3,054 species across Europe. Consistent with the thermal melanism theory, mushroom assemblages are significantly darker in areas with cold climates. We further show differences in color phenotype between fungal lifestyles and a lifestyle differentiated response to seasonality. These results indicate a more complex ecological role of mushroom colors and suggest functions beyond thermal adaption. Because fungi play a crucial role in terrestrial carbon and nutrient cycles, understanding the links between the thermal environment, functional coloration and species\u2019 geographical distributions will be critical in predicting ecosystem responses to global warming.",

    "volume": "574","number": "7780","pages": "671-674","abstract": "Recent reports of local extinctions of arthropod species 1 , and of massive declines in\r\narthropod biomass 2 , point to land-use intensification as a major driver of decreasing\r\nbiodiversity. However, to our knowledge, there are no multisite time series of arthropod occurrences across gradients of land-use intensity with which to confirm causal relationships. Moreover, it remains unclear which land-use types and arthropod groups are affected, and whether the observed declines in biomass and diversity are linked to one another. Here we analyse data from more than 1 million individual arthropods (about 2,700 species), from standardized inventories taken between 2008 and 2017 at 150 grassland and 140 forest sites in 3 regions of Germany. Overall gamma diversity in grasslands and forests decreased over time, indicating loss of species across sites and regions. In annually sampled grasslands, biomass, abundance and number of species declined by 67%, 78% and 34%, respectively. The decline was consistent across trophic levels and mainly affected rare species; its magnitude was independent of local land-use intensity. However, sites embedded in landscapes with a\r\nhigher cover of agricultural land showed a stronger temporal decline. In 30 forest sites with annual inventories, biomass and species number\u2014but not abundance\u2014decreased by 41% and 36%, respectively. This was supported by analyses of all forest sites sampled in three-year intervals. The decline affected rare and abundant species, and trends differed across trophic levels. Our results show that there are widespread declines in arthropod biomass, abundance and the number of species across trophic levels. Arthropod declines in forests demonstrate that loss is not restricted to open habitats. Our results suggest that major drivers of arthropod decline act at larger spatial scales, and are (at least for grasslands) associated with agriculture at the landscape level. This implies that policies need to address the landscape scale to mitigate the negative effects of land-use practices.",
